Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. </b></p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, <i>The Sandman </i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror. Even in your wildest dreams, you’ve never heard anything like this.</p>","title":"The Sandman","titleShort":"The Sandman"},{"added":327,"asin":"1721376666","authors":[{"name":"Mindy Kaling","url":"B001K8AZRE"}],"blurb":"From the acclaimed writer, actor, director, producer, and New York Times bestselling author comes Nothing Like I Imagined.

The strong-willed, patriotic Edna Heustis, who left home to work in a munitions factory, certainly doesn't belong behind bars.

Now that we are here, I suspect he has actually been sent to fulfill another secret mission. I am trying very hard not to pick a fight about it, because after all, we are in paradise! Darcy finally confides that there have been robberies in London and Paris. It seems the thief was a member of the aristocracy and may have fled to Kenya. Since we are staying in the Happy Valley - the center of upper-class English life - we are well positioned to hunt for clues and ferret out possible suspects.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Now that I am a sophisticated married woman, I am doing my best to sound like one. But crikey! These aristocrats are a thoroughly loathsome sort enjoying a completely decadent lifestyle filled with wild parties and rampant infidelity. And one of the leading lights in the community, Lord Cheriton, has the nerve to make a play for me. While I am on my honeymoon! Of course, I put an end to that right off.</p> <p>When he is found bloodied and lifeless along a lonely stretch of road, it appears he fell victim to a lion. But it seems that the Happy Valley community wants to close the case a bit too quickly. Darcy and I soon discover that there is much more than a simple robbery and an animal attack to contend with here in Kenya. Nearly everyone has a motive to want Lord Cheriton dead and some will go to great lengths to silence anyone who asks too many questions. The hunt is on!

coolest human/pooch duo this side of Wallace and Gromit\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p> <p>Combining suspense and intrigue with a wonderfully humorous take on the link between man and beast, Spencer Quinn's exceptional mystery series has captured widespread praise since its <i>New York Times</i> best-selling debut, <i>Dog on It</i>. <i>The Dog Who Knew Too Much</i> marks the duo's triumphant return in a tale that's full of surprises.</p> <p>Bernie is invited to give the keynote speech at the Great Western Private Eye Convention, but it's Chet that the bigshot P.I. in charge has secret plans for. Meanwhile Chet and Bernie are hired to find a kid who has gone missing from a wilderness camp in the high country. The boy's mother thinks the boy's father - her ex - has snatched the boy, but Chet makes a find that sends the case in a new and dangerous direction. As if that weren't enough, matters get complicated at home when a stray puppy that looks suspiciously like Chet shows up. Affairs of the heart collide with a job that's never been tougher, requiring our two intrepid sleuths to depend on each other as never before. <i>The Dog Who Knew Too Much</i> is classic Spencer Quinn, offering page-turning entertainment that's not just for dog-lovers.</p>","title":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much: A Chet and Bernie Mystery","titleShort":"The Dog Who Knew Too Much"},{"added":294,"asin":"B0036C4KMS","authors":[{"name":"Connie Willis","url":"B000APYUY2"}],"blurb":"Connie Willis returns with a stunning, enormously entertaining novel of time travel, war, and the deeds - great and small - of ordinary people who shape history.....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Historical Fiction","url":"18574482011"}],"cover":"51tFz+wd0SL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","isNew":true,"language":"English","length":"18h 44m","narrators":[{"name":"Katherine Kellgren"},{"name":"Connie Willis"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00465XTR6","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51oESO0K2RL","length":"23 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren, Connie Willis (introduction)","title":"All Clear"},{"asin":"B002V0A5LQ","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51ldq9+lobL","length":"20 hrs and 58 mins","narrators":"Steven Crossley","subHeading":"Or How We Found the Bishop's Bird Stump at Last","title":"To Say Nothing of the Dog"},{"asin":"B002V8KOHI","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51I4rprK-CL","length":"26 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Jenny Sterlin","title":"Doomsday Book"},{"asin":"B007IKJW8G","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51WVJU+qWkL","length":"29 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Dina Pearlman","title":"Passage"},{"asin":"B00FK6V93Q","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"41yI7NmTcnL","length":"16 hrs and 50 mins","narrators":"Eliza Foss, Jessica Almasy, Mia Barron, and others","subHeading":"Award-Winning Stories","title":"The Best of Connie Willis"},{"asin":"B01LYA1L7E","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51rVN4AMmvL","length":"18 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Mia Barron","title":"Crosstalk"},{"asin":"B0057YGZ62","authors":"Jo Walton","cover":"51QRp96wG6L","length":"10 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","title":"Among Others"},{"asin":"B07665V5YM","authors":"Connie Willis","cover":"51LXoCNWeQL","length":"22 hrs and 16 mins","narrators":"Eliza Foss, L.

Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day. Polly Churchill's next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of London's Blitz. And 17-year-old Colin Templer, who has a major crush on Polly, is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can catch up to her in age. But now the time-travel lab is suddenly canceling assignments for no apparent reason and switching around everyones schedules. And when Michael, Merope, and Polly finally get to World War II, things just get worse. For there they face air raids, blackouts, unexploded bombs, dive-bombing Stukas, rationing, shrapnel, V-1s, and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control. Because suddenly the once-reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches, and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief: that no historian can possibly change the past.</p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: In an exclusive introduction, author Connie Willis discusses her fascination with WWII and the historic context of <i>Blackout</i>.</b> </p> <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: <i>Blackout</i> is the first volume of a two-part novel.

His lovely&nbsp;fiancée has replaced his cozy wood stove with a modern electric one and is busy trying to “make a man of him.” The only man Hamish wants to be is the one who wanders about the village with his dog Towser, gossiping, fishing, and deftly solving a crime or two.&nbsp;</p> <p>Deciding that this may be a good time for a little retreat, Hamish ambles over to the nearby backwater of Drim, ostensibly to check out a posh English chap who is causing a most unusual problem. Single, wealthy, and terribly attractive, newcomer Peter Hynd has thrown the middle-aged matrons of Drim into a flutter and put their men, dour Highlanders whose feelings run deep, on a slow burn. Hamish’s instincts tell him this seemingly charming young man likes to stir up trouble, and it’s not long before the seething emotions transform the sleepy village into a hotbed of threats, domestic rows, and violent murder.&nbsp;</p> <p>With Hamish’s own relationship raising doubts about hearts and flowers, he’s more than ready to do what he now must: investigate the darker side of love.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","title":"Death of a Charming Man: The Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, Book 10","titleShort":"Death of a Charming Man"},{"added":286,"asin":"B007D43FN0","authors":[{"name":"M.

My duties are simple: help Marina acclimate to English life, show her the best of London, and, above all, dispel any rumors about George's libertine history. Perhaps that last bit isn't so simple. George is known for his many affairs with women as well as men - including the great songwriter Noel Coward.

He has - horrors! - been promoted, his new boss is a dunce, and a self-proclaimed traveler named Sean and his girlfriend have parked their rusty eyesore of a van in the middle of the village. Hamish smells trouble, and he's right, as usual. The doctor's drugs go missing. Money vanishes. Neighbors suddenly become unneighborly. The tension only explodes after the itinerant Sean is found brutally beaten to death in his camper. Suspicion quickly falls on his girlfriend, but with nobody willing to talk, the canny Hamish faces the tough task of worming the facts out of the villagers. As he uncovers a bizarre story around the murdered traveler, Macbeth knows he must find the truth soon - before the killer gets away for good. </p> <p>Police Sergeant Hamish Macbeth's new promotion means more money, but it also means that an eager beaver of a policeman has been thrust upon him, interfering with Hamish's easygoing way of life. Fans of the lazy Hamish will delight in seeing him pitted against a zealous young officer while solving a disturbing murder.</p>","title":"Death of a Traveling Man: The Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, Book 9","titleShort":"Death of a Traveling Man"},{"added":275,"asin":"B00GTSW53M","authors":[{"name":"M.

Not only are her table manners horrifying, but she has a habit of showing up at Maria’s carefully planned singles’ gatherings and spoiling everything by flirting with all the men. This time Maria is determined to keep her latest event a secret. </p> <p>The gathering is to be at Tommel Castle Hotel in the remote Scottish village of Lochdubh - the perfect setting for a particularly difficult group.

But does someone hate her enough to kill her? When she is found dead, an apple stuck unceremoniously in her mouth, Constable Hamish Macbeth is on the scene.

Together, they're plotting to overthrow Queen Levana and prevent her army from invading Earth. Their best hope lies with Cress, a girl trapped on a satellite since childhood who's only ever had her netscreens as company. All that screen time has made Cress an excellent hacker. Unfortunately, she's being forced to work for Queen Levana, and she's just received orders to track down Cinder and her handsome accomplice. When a daring rescue of Cress goes awry, the group is splintered. Cress finally has her freedom, but it comes at a higher price than she'd ever expected. Meanwhile, Queen Levana will let nothing prevent her marriage to Emperor Kai, especially the cyborg mechanic.

But when I agreed to read it for Audible, I had no idea how much work it would be, how intense it would be, and how deeply I would fall in love with it. There were places where I thought 'if I don't give Alexey Alexandrovitch the respect that he deserves in my reading of this scene, a critical part of the book will be ruined. If I don't give EVERYONE the utmost respect and understanding, I'm not doing justice to this brilliantly compassionate book.'

I feel like performing this novel is one of the major accomplishments of my work life - it was so challenging and so deep, a real pleasure.\" (Narrator Maggie Gyllenhaal) </p> <p>Leo Tolstoy's classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married Anna Karenina, and her tragic affair with dashing Count Vronsky. Maggie Gyllenhaal (<i>The Dark Knight</i>, <i>The Honourable Woman</i>) cites Tolstoy's epic as one of her favorite books of all time, and her love for the literature permeates her performance. <i>Anna Karenina</i> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life. </p>","title":"Anna Karenina","titleShort":"Anna Karenina"},{"added":246,"asin":"1094124931","authors":[{"name":"Ashley Poston","url":"B00H7KAML8"}],"blurb":"In the third book in Ashley Poston’s Once Upon a Con series, Beauty and the Beast is retold in the beloved Starfield universe as bad boy Vance Reigns meets his match in fanfiction writer Rosie Thorne....","categories":[{"name":"Teen","url":"18580715011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18580894011"}],"cover":"51BkanGHp3L","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"7h 21m","narrators":[{"name":"Caitlin Kelly"},{"name":"Curry Whitmire"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1982556528","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"51r8F3zUQoL","length":"9 hrs and 3 mins","narrators":"Eileen Stevens, Emily Lawrence, Caitlin Davies","subHeading":"A Geekerella Fairytale (The Once upon a Con Series, Book 2)","title":"The Princess and the Fangirl"},{"asin":"B06XXQWB9S","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"51kbpOH26GL","length":"10 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"Eileen Stevens, Tristan Morris","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Geekerella"},{"asin":"B01HDZUD10","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"51+CMQDfzML","length":"7 hrs and 16 mins","narrators":"Beckie Blosser","title":"We Own the Night"},{"asin":"0063025892","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"51DQwomc9fL","length":"8 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Hope Newhouse, Andrew Eiden","title":"Among the Beasts & Briars"},{"asin":"B07CSHMMNG","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"61V-b4+Q0iL","length":"12 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Adenrele Ojo","title":"Heart of Iron"},{"asin":"179710392X","authors":"Marisa Kanter","cover":"414L-0TWuwL","length":"9 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Dara Rosenberg","title":"What I Like About You"},{"asin":"059329131X","authors":"Jen DeLuca","cover":"41C1Pcc36TL","length":"9 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Brittany Pressley","title":"Well Played"},{"asin":"B00JU2AIKG","authors":"Ashley Poston","cover":"61KSNERXsCL","length":"6 hrs and 8 mins","narrators":"Beckie Blosser","title":"The Sound of Us"},{"asin":"1797108751","authors":"Sandhya Menon","cover":"61dDpNFjFLL","length":"11 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Vikas Adam, Soneela Nankani","title":"10 Things I Hate About Pinky"},{"asin":"1250758939","authors":"Marissa Meyer","cover":"51gO-ddyF0L","length":"14 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Rebecca Soler","title":"Instant Karma"},{"asin":"0062975145","authors":"Alex Light","cover":"51HScKSDl6L","length":"6 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Caitlin Kelly, Austin Rising","title":"The Upside of Falling"},{"asin":"1797101919","authors":"Sandhya Menon","cover":"51djYIOqC9S","length":"10 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Shiromi Arserio, Jason Carpenter","subHeading":"St. Rosetta's Academy, Book 1","title":"Of Curses and Kisses"},{"asin":"B0937LLD22","authors":"Morgan Matson","cover":"51n4qUJkz1S","length":"12 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Audrey Daly, Katie Snyder","title":"Take Me Home Tonight"},{"asin":"1250262755","authors":"Emma Lord","cover":"51J95v7oWbL","length":"10 hrs and 8 mins","narrators":"Dan Bittner, Emily Shaffer","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Tweet Cute"},{"asin":"0593151275","authors":"Jen DeLuca","cover":"410Be+-pXpL","length":"9 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Brittany Pressley","title":"Well Met"},{"asin":"0593341511","authors":"Jennifer Yen","cover":"51y+1FWlyoL","length":"8 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Josephine Huang","title":"A Taste for Love"},{"asin":"0593216857","authors":"Katharine McGee","cover":"516rGostEfL","length":"12 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Brittany Pressley","subHeading":"American Royals, Book 2","title":"American Royals II: Majesty"},{"asin":"0063005565","authors":"Olivia Dade","cover":"51RlMjEDx2L","length":"12 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Isabelle Ruther","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Spoiler Alert"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Blackstone Publishing"}],"rating":4.5,"ratings":454,"releaseDate":"2020-08-04","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/blak/014695/bk_blak_014695_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B07PPFWR6K","bookNumbers":["3"],"name":"Once Upon a Con Series"}],"summary":"<p><b>In the third book in Ashley Poston’s Once Upon a Con series,&nbsp;</b><b><i>Beauty and the Beast</i></b><b>&nbsp;is retold in the beloved Starfield universe as bad boy Vance Reigns meets his match in fanfiction writer Rosie Thorne.</b></p> <p>Rosie Thorne and her father have been short on luck - and money - for years.

His career is filled with so many “<i>he was there</i>” moments it’s a wonder he doesn’t recall them with the swagger of a conquering hero: songwriting and singing as a teenager in Detroit; co-founding Motown Records with Berry Gordy; creating 26 Top 40 hits with his group The Miracles; helping to spark racial integration of popular music in the 1960s; discovering hitmakers like Diana Ross and the Supremes; penning tunes for a jaw-droppingly diverse group of artists including Marvin Gaye, The Beatles, The Jackson Five, Kim Carnes, Linda Ronstadt; and releasing smash hits as solo artist well into the 1980s.</p> <p>But surprisingly, and delightfully, Robinson is as awed by his success as we are listening to him describe it. He guides us through his extraordinary career with the same giddy sense of discovery and delight that music fans recall the first time they heard one of his infectious tunes.</p> <p>He takes us back to his group’s first, disastrous performance at the Apollo Theater, opening for a brilliant and generous Ray Charles. He describes daily life at the famed Hitsville studio in Detroit, where a young Diana Ross or Martha Reeves could be found working as the receptionist. He shares his pride in being an influence on the Beatles and hearing his songs on their album - a transforming moment for the Motown sound. “I ain't never heard no popular white boys say anything like that ever. For them to come out and tell the world? They were my guys from then on.”</p> <p>And, of course, he takes us inside his songs. He describes where he was - shaving in the mirror at home - when “The Tracks of My Tears” finally came together. He remembers taking the wheel on the last 150 miles back to Detroit after a tour, humming the melody that would become the Temptations hit “The Way You Do the Things You Do.” He recalls being floored by the way a 10-year-old Michael Jackson brought a depth and soul to “Who’s Loving You.” And he explains where the term “Quiet Storm” originated, a song title that went on to become an entire musical genre.</p> <p>It’s a journey Robinson revisits with a grateful, humble heart. He has no agenda to push, no axes to grind, no scores to settle. He reflects on the ups as well as downs, and looks back with appreciation for the people who put love in his life. That makes listening a distinct pleasure: You get to spend time with a hugely influential artist who is warm, upbeat, and proud to have built a life and career through his art.</p>","title":"Smokey Robinson: Grateful and Blessed","titleShort":"Smokey Robinson: Grateful and Blessed"},{"added":239,"asin":"0593396960","authors":[{"name":"Ernest Cline","url":"B004XRR8Z6"}],"blurb":"The highly anticipated sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller Ready Player One, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"516MN+bKViL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"13h 46m ","narrators":[{"name":"Wil Wheaton"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1OF70","authors":"Frank Herbert","cover":"51f3UPrSPSL","length":"21 hrs and 2 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, Euan Morton, and others","title":"Dune"},{"asin":"B082BHJMFF","authors":"Andy Weir","cover":"414J3xG+7+L","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","title":"The Martian"},{"asin":"1774240688","authors":"Craig Anderson","cover":"517neYfHYQL","length":"8 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Peter Noble","subHeading":"One Up Series, Book 1","title":"Level Up"},{"asin":"B088C4DBYP","authors":"Dennis E.

Until Dreadnought fell out of the sky and died right in front of her, Danny was trying to keep people from finding out she's transgender. But before he expired, Dreadnought passed his mantle to her, and those secondhand superpowers transformed Danny's body into what she's always thought it should be. Now there's no hiding that she's a girl. </p> <p>It should be the happiest time of her life, but Danny's first weeks finally living in a body that fits her are more difficult and complicated than she could have imagined. Between her father's dangerous obsession with \"curing\" her girlhood, her best friend suddenly acting like he's entitled to date her, and her fellow superheroes arguing over her place in their ranks, Danny feels like she's in over her head. </p> <p>She doesn't have time to adjust. Dreadnought's murderer - a cyborg named Utopia - still haunts the streets of New Port City, threatening destruction. If Danny can't sort through the confusion of coming out, master her powers, and stop Utopia in time, humanity faces extinction. </p> <p>Original cover art copyright Diversion Publishing Corp. </p>","title":"Dreadnought","titleShort":"Dreadnought"},{"added":201,"asin":"1984844571","authors":[{"name":"Dorothy Dunnett","url":"B000APE786"}],"blurb":"Sixth in the legendary Lymond Chronicles, Checkmate takes place in 1557, where Francis Crawford of Lymond is once again in France, leading an army against England....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"cover":"51a-0V2bJWL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"28h 38m","narrators":[{"name":"David Monteath"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1405549661","authors":"Susanna Gregory","cover":"51hrWhMcwZS","length":"16 hrs and 8 mins","narrators":"Gordon Griffin","subHeading":"Adventures of Thomas Chaloner, Book 1","title":"A Conspiracy of Violence"},{"asin":"140554970X","authors":"Susanna Gregory","cover":"41gBaPlUbJS","length":"14 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Gordon Griffin","subHeading":"Adventures of Thomas Chaloner, Book 5","title":"A Murder on London Bridge"},{"asin":"140554967X","authors":"Susanna Gregory","cover":"51h3LOKGUwS","length":"14 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Gordon Griffin","subHeading":"Adventures of Thomas Chaloner, Book 2","title":"Blood on the Strand"},{"asin":"1405549688","authors":"Susanna Gregory","cover":"51xM4l8-Y8S","length":"15 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"Gordon Griffin","subHeading":"Adventures of Thomas Chaloner, Book 3","title":"The Butcher of Smithfield"},{"asin":"1405549696","authors":"Susanna Gregory","cover":"41nCyS8akwS","length":"15 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Gordon Griffin","subHeading":"Adventures of Thomas Chaloner, Book 4","title":"The Westminster Poisoner"},{"asin":"1529378850","authors":"Mary Stewart","cover":"519qjwOLOsL","length":"11 hrs and 58 mins","narrators":"Ellie Heydon","title":"Nine Coaches Waiting"},{"asin":"B00TQEM734","authors":"Peter Tremayne","cover":"619DB8PM4LL","length":"16 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Caroline Lennon","subHeading":"A Sister Fidelma Mystery of Ancient Ireland","title":"Hemlock at Vespers"},{"asin":"B01DFO5RZU","authors":"Andrew Taylor","cover":"61npgc-EouL","length":"12 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Leighton Pugh","title":"The Ashes of London"},{"asin":"147369132X","authors":"Mary Stewart","cover":"5182agU907L","length":"9 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Emilia Fox","subHeading":"The modern classic by the queen of romantic suspense","title":"Madam, Will You Talk?"},{"asin":"1541480260","authors":"Sharon Kay Penman","cover":"51gXSr7-TUL","length":"36 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Anne Flosnik","subHeading":"Plantagenets, Book 1","title":"When Christ and His Saints Slept"},{"asin":"1250751667","authors":"Kate Mosse","cover":"51WryynhqWL","length":"16 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"Hattie Morahan","subHeading":"Burning Chambers, Book 2","title":"The City of Tears: A Novel"},{"asin":"1250223954","authors":"Kate Mosse","cover":"51qrnDH+zOL","length":"17 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Hattie Morahan","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Burning Chambers"},{"asin":"B08SMC4R8S","authors":"E.M.

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale.

And while it hasn't landed me a job, or a husband, it has convinced Her Majesty the Queen and the Dowager Duchess to enlist my help. I have been entrusted with grooming Jack Altringham - the Duke's newly discovered heir fresh from the Outback of Australia - for high society. The upside is I am to live in luxury at one of England's most gorgeous stately homes. But upon arrival at Kingsdowne Place, my dearest Darcy has been sent to fetch Jack, leaving me stuck in a manor full of miscreants…none of whom are too pleased with the discovery of my new ward. And no sooner has the lad been retrieved than the Duke announces he wants to choose his own heir. With the house in a hubbub over the news, Jack's hunting knife somehow finds its way into the Duke's back. Eyes fall, backs turn, and fingers point to the young heir. As if the rascal wasn't enough of a handful, now he's suspected of murder. Jack may be wild, but I'd bet the crown jewels it wasn't he who killed the Duke….\"</p>","title":"Heirs and Graces","titleShort":"Heirs and Graces"},{"added":196,"asin":"B081ZFV1G3","authors":[{"name":"Will Wight","url":"B00D9S1IMO"}],"blurb":"The Guild of Navigators has ruled the Aion Sea for centuries, using their fleet of mystical ships to collect trade for the Aurelian Empire.

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","title":"Artemis","titleShort":"Artemis"},{"added":158,"asin":"B00YD7ASXA","authors":[{"name":"Neil Gaiman","url":"B000AQ01G2"}],"blurb":"You may think you know this story.

As the city prepares to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, Veronica Speedwell is marking a milestone of her own. After burying her spinster aunt, the orphaned Veronica is free to resume her world travels in pursuit of scientific inquiry - and the occasional romantic dalliance. As familiar with hunting butterflies as she is fending off admirers, Veronica wields her butterfly net and a sharpened hatpin with equal aplomb, and with her last connection to England now gone, she intends to embark upon the journey of a lifetime. But fate has other plans, as Veronica discovers when she thwarts her own abduction with the help of an enigmatic German baron with ties to her mysterious past. Promising to reveal in time what he knows of the plot against her, the baron offers her temporary sanctuary in the care of his friend Stoker - a reclusive natural historian as intriguing as he is bad-tempered. But before the baron can deliver on his tantalizing vow to reveal the secrets he has concealed for decades, he is found murdered. Suddenly Veronica and Stoker are forced to go on the run from an elusive assailant, wary partners in search of the villainous truth. </p>","title":"A Curious Beginning","titleShort":"A Curious Beginning"},{"added":148,"asin":"B015RJL1Z6","authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu","url":"B00456AFZA"}],"blurb":"Audible Originals bring you a brand new audiobook adaptation of J.

Try having one for a boss, or co-worker. That’s the predicament Andrea Vernon finds herself in as the heroine of Alexander C. Kane’s debut audiobook. Drowning in debt, and forced to move back into her parents’ Queens apartment, Andrea starts looking for a job. Luckily for her, she finds herself recruited—well, really kidnapped—by the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (C.U.P.), an organization that deploys superheroes. Suddenly Andrea must contend with co-workers who can shoot lightning from their fingertips, face the imminent destruction of humanity, and juggle a fledgling romance with a giant lumberjack.

The sisters face threats of arson, kidnapping, and white slavery. Bricks come flying through their windows, and shots are fired at their house late at night. Even the sheriff can't solve the case on his own. He issues revolvers to the Kopp sisters, posts guards at their house, and enlists Constance's help in catching Kaufman.

But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>All These Worlds</i> is the third installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.</p>","title":"All These Worlds: Bobiverse, Book 3","titleShort":"All These Worlds"},{"added":99,"asin":"B00HUZO3CE","authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

To start building a more straightforward, accurate understanding of current breakthroughs in neuroscience, you have to start by shattering popular brain myths. </p> <p>Each of these 24 lectures takes as its focus a single powerful, prevalent brain myth, and uses it as a launch pad from which to explore myriad topics in neuroscience: decision making, memory, dreams, emotions, neuroplasticity, consciousness, mental illness, and much more. </p> <p>Our memory is an accurate, objective record of the past. Our senses reflect the world as it really exists. Our dreams have hidden meanings. We are only using 10% of our total brain power. Modern technology (including social media) is making us less intelligent. Dr. Viskontas doesn't just settle for obliterating these and other myths. Instead, she replaces them with scientific facts gathered from experiments, research, and case studies. The result is an eye-opening adventure into the latest understanding of why the brain works the way it does. </p> <p>Whatever order you enjoy these lectures in, you'll be left with insights that will help you better determine the hard scientific truths behind the breaking news (and myths) of tomorrow. </p>","title":"Brain Myths Exploded: Lessons from Neuroscience","titleShort":"Brain Myths Exploded"},{"added":95,"asin":"B00DGBECNG","authors":[{"name":"John McWhorter","url":"/search"},{"name":"The Great Courses","url":"B06XPWVHFB"}],"blurb":"Learn how a single tongue spoken 150,000 years ago evolved into the estimated 6,000 languages used around the world today....","categories":[{"name":"History","url":"18573518011"},{"name":"Ancient History","url":"18573549011"}],"cover":"51CiRpyQQRL","format":"Lecture","language":"English","length":"18h 15m","narrators":[{"name":"John McWhorter"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1629976415","authors":"John McWhorter, The Great Courses","cover":"519saqhVshL","length":"15 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"John McWhorter","title":"Language Families of the World"},{"asin":"B00CYNMAIG","authors":"Susan Wise Bauer","cover":"514bRHmeDnL","length":"26 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"John Lee","subHeading":"From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome","title":"The History of the Ancient World"},{"asin":"B00D8EMBVQ","authors":"Ken Albala, The Great Courses","cover":"51-voCeBceL","length":"18 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Ken Albala","title":"Food: A Cultural Culinary History"},{"asin":"B00DDVPXJG","authors":"Robert Garland, The Great Courses","cover":"61XaLYB1rfL","length":"24 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Robert Garland","title":"The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World"},{"asin":"B00SJIVE3W","authors":"Kevin Flanigan, The Great Courses","cover":"51mCLnDtvgL","length":"18 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Kevin Flanigan","title":"Building a Better Vocabulary"},{"asin":"B00DICD9BE","authors":"Bob Brier, The Great Courses","cover":"51KUkGV89PL","length":"24 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Bob Brier","title":"The History of Ancient Egypt"},{"asin":"0593344863","authors":"John McWhorter","cover":"51szNel9gKS","length":"6 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"John McWhorter","subHeading":"English in the Gutter: Then, Now, and Forever","title":"Nine Nasty Words"},{"asin":"B07DX83FZC","authors":"Edwin Barnhart, The Great Courses","cover":"61G86HWyAGL","length":"12 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"Edwin Barnhart","title":"Ancient Civilizations of North America"},{"asin":"B013KRSIVC","authors":"The Great Courses, Grant L.

Frequently joined by a number of historians, authors, and reenactors, Fry seems to be having a wonderful time recounting some of the fascinating arcana of the ostensibly tightly wound Victorian Era. With whimsical music to mark the short, informative, and entertaining chapters, Fry delivers hidden truths and juicy secrets on subjects ranging from scandals and sanitation to sexuality and sadism. Diaries, journals, newspaper articles, and historical materials of the period offer listeners you-are-there reenactments of crime, sex, freaks, medical practices, and more - all interspersed with Fry's amusing commentary. Thanks to Fry, audio is unquestionably the best way to enjoy this material.

It launched the careers of some of today's most significant comedians, highlighted the hypocrisies of the powerful, and garnered 23 Emmys. Now the show's behind-the-scenes gags, controversies, and camaraderie are chronicled by the players themselves, from legendary host Jon Stewart to the star cast members and writers - including Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Steve Carell, Lewis Black, Jessica Williams, John Hodgman, and Larry Wilmore - plus some of <i>The Daily Show</i>'s most prominent guests and adversaries: John and Cindy McCain, Glenn Beck, Tucker Carlson, and many more. </p> <p>This oral history takes the listener behind the curtain for all the show's highlights, from its origins as Comedy Central's underdog late-night program hosted by Craig Kilborn to Jon Stewart's long reign to Trevor Noah's succession, rising from a scrappy jester in the 24-hour political news cycle to become part of the beating heart of politics - a trusted source for not only comedy but also commentary, with a reputation for calling bullshit and an ability to effect real change in the world. </p> <p>Through years of incisive election coverage, Jon Stewart's emotional monologue in the wake of 9/11, his infamous confrontation on <i>Crossfire</i>, passionate debates with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, feuds with Bill O'Reilly and Fox, the Indecisions, Mess O'Potamia, and provocative takes on Wall Street and racism,<i> The Daily Show </i>has been a cultural touchstone. Now, for the first time, the people behind the show's seminal moments come together to share their memories of the last-minute rewrites, improvisations, pranks, romances, blowups, and moments of Zen both on and off the set of one of America's most groundbreaking shows. </p> <p>Full cast of narrators includes Ryan Vincent Anderson, Graham Halstead, Cheryl Smith, Christian Coulson, Tommy Harron, and Elece Green. </p>","title":"The Daily Show (the AudioBook): An Oral History as Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests","titleShort":"The Daily Show (the AudioBook)"},{"added":85,"asin":"B0054WI286","authors":[{"name":"Richard Dawkins","url":"B000AQ3RBI"}],"blurb":"The Blind Watchmaker is as prescient and timely a book as ever....","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"cover":"51EySGZ-3aL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"14h 40m","narrators":[{"name":"Richard Dawkins"},{"name":"Lalla Ward"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07MNH2T6M","authors":"DK","cover":"61eQEOTYw-L","length":"16 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Jason Culp","subHeading":"Big Ideas Simply Explained","title":"The Philosophy Book"},{"asin":"B002V086LM","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"61zewFaBaYL","length":"14 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","subHeading":"The Evidence for Evolution","title":"The Greatest Show on Earth"},{"asin":"1682769992","authors":"Benjamin Schumacher, The Great Courses","cover":"51rn8IJrEhL","length":"12 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Benjamin Schumacher","title":"Black Holes, Tides, and Curved Spacetime"},{"asin":"B0036MX44S","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"51CAlg5SRUL","length":"13 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","title":"The God Delusion"},{"asin":"B004QDTA9Y","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"51iqpxo43PL","length":"16 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","title":"The Selfish Gene"},{"asin":"B075B1ZM1Q","authors":"Govert Schilling, Martin Rees","cover":"61DnhlAdt5L","length":"11 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Joel Richards","subHeading":"Einstein, Gravitational Waves, and the Future of Astronomy","title":"Ripples in Spacetime"},{"asin":"0593147421","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"61hdhPRs8BL","length":"6 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins","subHeading":"A Beginner's Guide","title":"Outgrowing God"},{"asin":"B003X3RJE6","authors":"Jonathan Weiner","cover":"51v3mc89wtL","length":"12 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Victor Bevine","subHeading":"A Story of Evolution in Our Time","title":"The Beak of the Finch"},{"asin":"B00375CTPE","authors":"Sean Carroll","cover":"510Y5qH15uL","length":"16 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Erik Synnestvedt","subHeading":"The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time","title":"From Eternity to Here"},{"asin":"B00HFXCS96","authors":"Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee","cover":"61S4aDkYjsL","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins","narrators":"Jeff Cummings","subHeading":"Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies","title":"The Second Machine Age"},{"asin":"B006P482NC","authors":"Francis Fukuyama","cover":"61gq5FFgFRL","length":"22 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","title":"The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution"},{"asin":"B00UZCB2BO","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"51cQjC9vW3L","length":"8 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","subHeading":"A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution","title":"The Ancestor's Tale"},{"asin":"B005MKCEZW","authors":"Richard Dawkins","cover":"61067i6rH-L","length":"6 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","subHeading":"How We Know What's Really True","title":"The Magic of Reality"},{"asin":"B07BH3R926","authors":"Bryan Caplan","cover":"51gEtUAPuKL","length":"11 hrs","narrators":"Allan Robertson","subHeading":"Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money","title":"The Case Against Education"},{"asin":"B0179XK9VU","authors":"George Musser","cover":"61DuUi-PFKL","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"William Hughes","subHeading":"The Phenomenon That Reimagines Space and Time-and What It Means for Black Holes, the Big Bang, and Theories of Everything","title":"Spooky Action at a Distance"},{"asin":"B00EZWRL7Y","authors":"Daniel C.

In Dr. Kaku's eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. </p> <p>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the \"inflationary universe theory\", a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. </p> <p>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today physicists overwhelmingly support string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this one theory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly and answer the question \"what happened before the big bang?\" </p> <p>Already, Kaku explains, the world's foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless.

Experience an enthralling performance featuring a cast of rising Broadway stars who join actress and author Alexandra Silber in celebrating the Audible release of<i> After Anatevka</i>, the sweeping historical novel she wrote about Tevye’s second-eldest daughter, Hodel. Silber’s fascination with Hodel began when she played her in a production of <i>Fiddler</i> in London’s West End. Actors often write a backstory for the characters they play so they can fully imagine and embody them onstage. But Silber was more interested in Hodel’s fate than her history. “I had never played a character who felt so much like me,” she says. “I felt responsible for what happened to her after she boards the train to Siberia to join her revolutionary fiancé Perchik.”</p> <p>Originally commissioned by Symphony Space, a form of this concert was produced in March 2017. <i>After Anatevka Live</i> brings to life dramatic excerpts from Silber’s novel with five original songs by contemporary composer and lyricist teams, plus two much-loved songs from <i>Fiddler</i> and one gem that was cut from the final song book. Directed by Carolyn Cantor with musical direction by Ben Moss and an introduction from Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning <i>Fiddler</i> lyricist Sheldon Harnick, this is a charming and magical event for any lover of musical theater.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Cover art photo by Michael Kushner</i>&nbsp;</p>","title":"After Anatevka: Live","titleShort":"After Anatevka: Live"},{"added":81,"asin":"B07F3YYJS2","authors":[{"name":"Jane Austen","url":"B000APWOKO"},{"name":"Anna Lea - adaptation","url":"B0034PDSUC"}],"blurb":"A lively comedy of manners, with a witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"51tkJih-QpL","downloaded":true,"format":"Original Recording Audiobook","language":"English","length":"8h 21m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Emma Thompson"},{"name":"Joanne Froggatt"},{"name":"Isabella Inchbald"},{"name":"Aisling Loftus"},{"name":"Joseph Millson"},{"name":"Morgana Robinson"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B076XNN4KF","authors":"Jan Smith","cover":"51aUxZbIRtL","length":"4 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Angela Griffin, Robert James-Collier, Katherine Kelly, and others","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Killer by Nature"},{"asin":"B07FDJQ8YH","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"51TyQNTZVlL","length":"11 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","title":"Sense and Sensibility"},{"asin":"B082MQ5TDB","authors":"Matthew Derby","cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","title":"Phreaks"},{"asin":"B016LN23CC","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"51y-ivhKErL","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","title":"Pride and Prejudice"},{"asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","title":"When You Finish Saving the World"},{"asin":"B08DDCVRRC","authors":"Tyler Shultz","cover":"51Di+gUJ9HL","length":"3 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Tyler Shultz","title":"Thicker than Water"},{"asin":"B072JZ18JB","authors":"Jane Austen, Anna Lea - adaptation","cover":"51aNFG4ELmL","length":"6 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Emma Thompson, Douglas Booth, Eleanor Tomlinson, and others","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Northanger Abbey"},{"asin":"B089T5SW3N","authors":"Dan Rather","cover":"51NK159FbkL","length":"1 hr and 24 mins","narrators":"Dan Rather","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime"},{"asin":"B085F3F6CX","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","cover":"51GKoszPFmL","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","title":"Stuck"},{"asin":"B08DDJ56J2","authors":"Joan Didion","cover":"513oKbpMTgL","length":"1 hr and 28 mins","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking"},{"asin":"B0883GHNZQ","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","length":"1 hr and 13 mins","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","title":"Bella Bella"},{"asin":"B08DG7X16V","authors":"Common, Awoye Timpo, NSangou Njikam","cover":"516mu-GabiL","length":"1 hr and 21 mins","narrators":"Common","subHeading":"A Journey Through Lyrics & Life","title":"Bluebird Memories"}],"progress":"Finished","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"rating":4.4,"ratings":18253,"releaseDate":"2018-09-04","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000226/or_orig_000226_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B07GX32LCW","name":"Audible's Jane Austen"}],"summary":"<p>This Audible Original production of Jane Austen’s <i>Emma </i>is narrated by Emma Thompson (Academy Award, Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA winner, <i>Love Actually</i>, Harry Potter, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>), with a full supporting cast including Joanne Froggatt (<i>Downton Abbey</i>, <i>Liar</i>), Morgana Robinson (<i>The Windsors</i>, <i>Walliams &amp; Friend</i>, <i>Morgana Robinson's the Agency</i>), Aisling Loftus (<i>Mr Selfridge</i>, <i>War &amp; Peace</i>), Joseph Millson (<i>Casino Royale</i>, T<i>he Sarah Jane Adventures</i>) and rising star Isabella Inchbald as our eponymous heroine.</p> <p>Before she began writing <i>Emma</i>, Austen wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like' and thus introduces the handsome, clever, rich - and flawed, Emma Woodhouse.

With the period detail and deep resonance of <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i>, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.</p> <p>Lily is haunted by memories of who she once was, and of a person, long gone, who defined her existence. She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In 19th-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (\"women's writing\"). Some girls were paired with laotongs, \"old sames\", in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments.</p> <p>With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become \"old sames\" at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart.</p>","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan: A Novel","titleShort":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan"},{"added":77,"asin":"B00JIYMJZ8","authors":[{"name":"Laini Taylor","url":"B001JS0AOI"}],"blurb":"In this thrilling conclusion to the Daughter of Smoke & Bone trilogy, Karou is still not ready to forgive Akiva for killing the only family she's ever known....","categories":[{"name":"Teen","url":"18580715011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18580894011"}],"cover":"51UFzzpBJ-L","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"18h 8m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Khristine Hvam"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00H3R2MVI","authors":"Laini Taylor","cover":"51MMXJ1NSvL","length":"2 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Khristine Hvam, Kevin T.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger.</i> </p> <p>Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much-celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; <i>The Illustrated Mein</i>, <i>Dandelion Wine</i>, <i>The October Country</i>, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. </p> <p>Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor - of crystal pillars and fossil seas - where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn - first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars...and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. </p> <p>Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> is a classic work of 20th-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision and his heart - starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.</p>","title":"The Martian Chronicles","titleShort":"The Martian Chronicles"},{"added":70,"asin":"B002V5BE1Q","authors":[{"name":"Isaac Asimov","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey human orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Anthologies & Short Stories","url":"18574446011"}],"cover":"419uCX4uDNL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"8h 20m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"Scott Brick"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00KTEHMPI","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"41IOFTkDDmL","length":"7 hrs and 41 mins","narrators":"William Dufris","subHeading":"The Robot Series, Book 2","title":"The Naked Sun"},{"asin":"B00KTEH7WQ","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"41cZBr5dvIL","length":"15 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"William Dufris","subHeading":"The Robot Series, Book 3","title":"The Robots of Dawn"},{"asin":"B00KY3AP30","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"41IOddAV90L","length":"7 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"William Dufris","subHeading":"Robot, Book 1","title":"The Caves of Steel"},{"asin":"B00NYCMZQS","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"510RpF-HmfL","length":"14 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"George Guidall","title":"Robot Dreams"},{"asin":"B003D8S2ME","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"61alyzIEq3L","length":"9 hrs and 21 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Second Foundation"},{"asin":"B003D8W5VS","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"61QIQo4laPL","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Foundation"},{"asin":"B005T6ZETM","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"61P73AO6jkL","length":"14 hrs and 55 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Prelude to Foundation"},{"asin":"B005WWT7TQ","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"61cO89Wz8WL","length":"18 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Larry McKeever","title":"Foundation and Earth"},{"asin":"B005WL4R7E","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"610iza6h9tL","length":"16 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Foundation's Edge"},{"asin":"B003FCV4O6","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"51DxbydBZxL","length":"9 hrs and 33 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"Foundation and Empire"},{"asin":"0593346041","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"41YWuBmjskL","length":"8 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom","subHeading":"Galactic Empire, Book 2","title":"The Currents of Space"},{"asin":"B005WWT30E","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"51hvpRVM3NL","length":"16 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Larry McKeever","title":"Forward the Foundation"},{"asin":"0593345967","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"319BHi+uf2L","length":"8 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom","subHeading":"Galactic Empire, Book 3","title":"Pebble in the Sky"},{"asin":"0593152778","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"51jD6JU408L","length":"14 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Nemesis"},{"asin":"0593346025","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"31NgLnVNuOL","length":"8 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom","title":"The Stars, Like Dust"},{"asin":"B00HJZAQPI","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"616bk-mgICL","length":"11 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"The Gods Themselves"},{"asin":"0593345983","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"4135EQeLf2L","length":"8 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Jon Lindstrom","title":"The End of Eternity"},{"asin":"B002V9ZFX0","authors":"Philip K.

Montag never questions the destruction and ruin his actions produce, returning each day to his bland life and wife, Mildred, who spends all day with her television \"family\". But then he meets an eccentric young neighbor, Clarisse, who introduces him to a past where people didn’t live in fear and to a present where one sees the world through the ideas in books instead of the mindless chatter of television. When Mildred attempts suicide and Clarisse suddenly disappears, Montag begins to question everything he has ever known.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p> <p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p> <p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point. </p> <p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed. </p>","title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court","titleShort":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"},{"added":62,"asin":"B002UZMVSC","authors":[{"name":"Diana Wynne Jones","url":"B000AP7PX0"}],"blurb":"A girl named Charmain must inhabit her ailing great-uncle's time-traveling home full of magical belongings....","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18572491011"}],"cover":"5112W0N0TJS","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"7h 57m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Jenny Sterlin"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1OQW4","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51YFDzk5DWS","length":"7 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Jenny Sterlin","title":"Castle in the Air"},{"asin":"B002V5BB5U","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"518lQlWVD6S","length":"8 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Jenny Sterlin","title":"Howl's Moving Castle"},{"asin":"059320820X","authors":"Eiko Kadono, Emily Balistrieri - translator","cover":"511NWid74gL","length":"4 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Kim Mai Guest","title":"Kiki's Delivery Service"},{"asin":"1977380549","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51bbP3JIEvL","length":"13 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Gildart Jackson","subHeading":"Derkholm Series, Book 1","title":"Dark Lord of Derkholm"},{"asin":"B002VA965W","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51csDI6VESL","length":"8 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Gerard Doyle","subHeading":"The Worlds of Chrestomanci","title":"Conrad's Fate"},{"asin":"B004GAVE8W","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"61ItxOJGQoL","length":"8 hrs and 10 mins","narrators":"Steven Crossley","title":"Enchanted Glass"},{"asin":"1705265944","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51vJunbcgBS","length":"11 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Gemma Dawson","title":"Fire and Hemlock"},{"asin":"B002V0KKVQ","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"61cZAKdAKiL","length":"9 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Gerard Doyle","title":"The Lives of Christopher Chant"},{"asin":"B002V1LUZU","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51r39L53-kL","length":"9 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Gerard Doyle","title":"The Pinhoe Egg"},{"asin":"B007OV4Y46","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"6124Tk1uuwL","length":"1 hr and 11 mins","narrators":"Charlotte Parry","title":"Earwig and the Witch"},{"asin":"1977380557","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51FUlrBPVdL","length":"9 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Gemma Dawson","subHeading":"Derkholm, Book 2","title":"Year of the Griffin"},{"asin":"1977364276","authors":"Patricia C.

Noah’s virtuoso embodiment of all the characters from his childhood, and his ability to perform accents and dialects effortlessly in English, Xhosa, and Zulu, garnered the Audie Award for Best Male Narrator in 2018.

The incentives for her to accept him are strong, but she is honest enough to tell him that she does not return his affections. He says he can accept that - but will either of them ever be truly happy in a relationship of unequal affection?</p><p>Diverging from Jane Austen's classic novel <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> at the proposal in the Hunsford parsonage, this story explores the kind of man Darcy is, even before his \"proper humbling,\" and how such a man, so full of pride, so much in love, might have behaved had

Secrecy is the key to Faerie’s survival—but no secret can be kept forever, and when the fae and mortal worlds collide, changelings are born. Half-human, half-fae, outsiders from birth, these second-class children of Faerie spend their lives fighting for the respect of their immortal relations. Or, in the case of October “Toby” Daye, rejecting it completely.</p> <p>After getting burned by both sides of her heritage, Toby has denied the fae world, retreating into a “normal” life. Unfortunately for her, Faerie has other ideas. The murder of Countess Evening Winterrose, one of the secret regents of the San Francisco Bay Area, pulls Toby back into the fae world. Unable to resist Evening’s dying curse, which binds her to investigate, Toby is forced to resume her old position as knight errant to the Duke of Shadowed Hills and begin renewing old alliances that may prove her only hope of solving the mystery...before the curse catches up with her. </p>","title":"Rosemary and Rue: An October Daye Novel, Book 1","titleShort":"Rosemary and Rue"},{"added":28,"asin":"B002V5B83U","authors":[{"name":"Wendelin Van Drannen","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"When Sammy's mother dumped her with Grams to go to Hollywood and become a star, Sammy dealt with it....","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18572491011"}],"cover":"51X0kTEmvoL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"6h 42m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Tara Sands"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V1BL04","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51GvHyjMMeL","length":"6 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Search for Snake Eyes"},{"asin":"B002UZZ61G","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51dOs8xhA5L","length":"6 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Curse of Moustache Mary"},{"asin":"B002V1J8T0","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51j5ECqo2SL","length":"5 hrs and 14 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Sisters of Mercy"},{"asin":"B002V1OO6M","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51SCCizmLDL","length":"4 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Runaway Elf"},{"asin":"B002V57VEK","authors":"Wendelin Van Drannen","cover":"515WFM0UdFL","length":"6 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Psycho Kitty Queen"},{"asin":"B002VA3HCK","authors":"Wendelin Van Drannen","cover":"51-yqce214L","length":"7 hrs and 3 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Art of Deception"},{"asin":"B002V01GOG","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51mFQcNGIZL","length":"4 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Skeleton Man"},{"asin":"B002V8KM70","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"5132-yNQi8L","length":"7 hrs and 3 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Dead Giveaway"},{"asin":"B002VA9JY0","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51JwGUbD99L","length":"3 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Hotel Thief"},{"asin":"B0735ZD4KT","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51zpx8PR6hL","length":"7 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Cold Hard Cash"},{"asin":"B0735WSKSX","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51bbw8s18kL","length":"7 hrs and 8 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Wild Things"},{"asin":"B0735YFKD1","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51BhrjmADSL","length":"8 hrs and 5 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Wedding Crasher"},{"asin":"B0735Y68N5","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51Xsg88P0iL","length":"7 hrs and 42 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Power of Justice Jack"},{"asin":"B07L39TJR7","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"5187Szp6dYL","length":"8 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Killer Cruise"},{"asin":"1430136820","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"510sJ6a+NpL","length":"6 hrs and 23 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands, Wendelin Van Draanen","subHeading":"Sammy Keyes, Book 18","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Kiss Goodbye"},{"asin":"B075FCG66B","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51o3+6hoFYL","length":"6 hrs and 47 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Showdown in Sin City"},{"asin":"B0735YVTNG","authors":"Wendelin Van Draanen","cover":"51LbbTA9A1L","length":"8 hrs and 5 mins","narrators":"Tara Sands","title":"Sammy Keyes and the Night of Skulls"},{"asin":"B00A9YD5LS","authors":"Barbara Robinson","cover":"51sxJrHt9dL","length":"1 hr and 52 mins","narrators":"C.

She is about to start seventh grade, and for kids from Maine's Burning Fog Island, that means leaving their little white schoolhouse for regular classrooms and life on the mainland. Everyone assures Christina it will be a fantastic year. Mainland school offers great advantages, after all: extracurricular activities other than boating and fishing, a gym, a cafeteria, and more kids her age. Best of all, this year the boarding students will live at the historic Schooner Inne, a former sea captain's house (and now a bed and breakfast) recently bought by the school's charismatic new principal and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington. </p><p>But Christina is apprehensive. She adores the wildness and excitement of her island life. Boarding with her island friends will surely help: Anya, a beautiful senior, fifteen-year-old Benji, the aspiring lobsterman, and his crush-worthy younger brother Michael. But Christina's apprehension sharpens when Benji and Michael aren't as friendly as they used to be on the island, and Anya starts acting so strangely it seems she is slowly losing her mind. Christina is increasingly certain the Shevvingtons are behind all of these changes. But no one else can see the Shevvingtons' eerie behavior - not other teachers, not her parents, not even her fellow island kids.

If Ella wants to escape her father's home, and her awful new stepfamily, she must convince her doctors that she's capable, both physically and emotionally, of living on her own. The problem is, she's not ready yet.

Oliver Sacks' <i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i> tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; who are no longer able to recognize people and common objects; who are stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; whose limbs have become alien; who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. </p> <p>If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. Sacks' splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Is Ender the general Earth needs?&nbsp;</p> <p>But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world.

One of the most critically acclaimed suspense writers of our time, <i>New York Times</i> best seller Gillian Flynn, takes that statement to its darkest place in this unpausable masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong. The <i>Chicago Tribune</i> proclaimed that her work \"draws you in and keeps you reading with the force of a pure but nasty addiction.\" <i>Gone Girl</i>'s toxic mix of sharp-edged wit and deliciously chilling prose creates a nerve-fraying thriller that confounds you at every turn. </p> <p>On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. </p> <p>Under mounting pressure from the police and the media - as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents - the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he's definitely bitter - but is he really a killer? </p> <p>As the cops close in, every couple in town is soon wondering how well they know the one that they love. With his twin sister, Margo, at his side, Nick stands by his innocence. Trouble is, if Nick didn't do it, where is that beautiful wife? And what was in that silvery gift box hidden in the back of her bedroom closet? </p> <p>With her razor-sharp writing and trademark psychological insight, Gillian Flynn delivers a fast-paced, devilishly dark, and ingeniously plotted thriller that confirms her status as one of the hottest writers around.</p>","title":"Gone Girl: A Novel","titleShort":"Gone Girl"},{"added":7,"asin":"B004Y71J1O","authors":[{"name":"Gail Carson Levine","url":"B00O1AUF8W"}],"blurb":"Elodie journeys to the town of Two Castles to become a mansioner - an actress - but the master of the troupe turns her away....","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Mystery & Suspense","url":"18572548011"}],"cover":"61ciFDym87L","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"8h 27m ","myRating":"5","narrators":[{"name":"Sarah Coomes"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B06XY74NWJ","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"51BIseS1otL","length":"8 hrs and 29 mins","narrators":"January LaVoy","title":"The Lost Kingdom of Bamarre"},{"asin":"B06XXQKFMS","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"61MT1b12LML","length":"6 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"January LaVoy","title":"The Two Princesses of Bamarre"},{"asin":"B07FHK2V38","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"510H+QmDEyL","length":"7 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"January LaVoy","title":"Ogre Enchanted"},{"asin":"B0189MUBMM","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"51BgAwVv1aL","length":"8 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Soneela Nankani","title":"Fairest"},{"asin":"B002UZKXX2","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"51dDcIghSQL","length":"5 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Eden Riegel","title":"Ella Enchanted"},{"asin":"B002V5B6U0","authors":"Gail Carson Levine","cover":"617z+5J3sdL","length":"5 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"Jenna Lamia, Oliver Wyman","title":"Ever"},{"asin":"B00B8DCD1W","authors":"Shannon Hale","cover":"61I82QvDfjL","length":"11 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Cynthia Bishop","subHeading":"Book Four of the Books of Bayern","title":"Forest Born"},{"asin":"1977380549","authors":"Diana Wynne Jones","cover":"51bbP3JIEvL","length":"13 hrs and 35 mins","narrators":"Gildart Jackson","subHeading":"Derkholm Series, Book 1","title":"Dark Lord of Derkholm"},{"asin":"1338722565","authors":"Emily Jenkins, Lauren Myracle, Sarah Mlynowski","cover":"51qcjYkFX+L","length":"19 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Rebecca Soler","title":"Upside Down Magic Collection (Books 1-6)"},{"asin":"B002V1NFZS","authors":"Patricia C.

A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail - and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.</p> <p>In 1978, Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.</p> <p>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition</i> includes material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a gripping work with the scope and moral complexity of a true epic.</p> <p>For hundreds of thousands of fans who heard <i>The Stand</i> in its original version and wanted more, this new edition is Stephen King's gift. And those who are listening to <i>The Stand</i> for the first time will discover a triumphant and eerily plausible work of the imagination that takes on the issues that will determine our survival.</p> <p>Cover artwork ©2020 CBS Interactive Inc.</p>","title":"The Stand","titleShort":"The Stand"},{"added":2,"asin":"B00RD96G8Q","authors":[{"name":"Kimberly Loth","url":"B00JWSKRYA"}],"blurb":"Trapped in a dark cult, sixteen-year-old Naomi Aren has lived a quiet, albeit unhappy, life nestled deep in the hills of the Ozarks....","categories":[{"name":"Romance","url":"18580518011"},{"name":"Paranormal","url":"18580534011"}],"cover":"61saCV7FEUL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"8h 10m ","myRating":"3","narrators":[{"name":"Emma Lysy"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B016CF5BXM","authors":"Kimberly Loth","cover":"61JHvz1zMgL","length":"6 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Emma Lysy","subHeading":"The Thorn Chronicles, Book 2","title":"Destroyer Angel"},{"asin":"B00KMDWK0I","authors":"S.J.

Don't try to smuggle a phone or any other piece of technology over the wall that marks the Border - unless you enjoy a fireworks display in your backpack. (Ballpoint pens are okay.) There are elves, harpies, and - best of all as far as Elliot is concerned - mermaids.&nbsp;</p> <p>Elliot? Who's Elliot? Elliot is 13 years old. He's smart and just a tiny bit obnoxious. Sometimes more than a tiny bit. When his class goes on a field trip and he can see a wall that no one else can see, he is given the chance to go to school in the Borderlands. It turns out that on the other side of the wall, classes involve a lot more weaponry and fitness training and fewer mermaids than he expected.&nbsp;</p> <p>On the other hand, there's Serene-Heart-in-the-Chaos-of-Battle, an elven warrior who is more beautiful than anyone Elliot has ever seen, and then there's her human friend Luke: sunny, blond, and annoyingly likeable.

He describes daily life at the famed Hitsville studio in Detroit, where a young Diana Ross or Martha Reeves could be found working as the receptionist. He shares his pride in being an influence on the Beatles and hearing his songs on their album - a transforming moment for the Motown sound. “I ain't never heard no popular white boys say anything like that ever. For them to come out and tell the world? They were my guys from then on.”</p> <p>And, of course, he takes us inside his songs. He describes where he was - shaving in the mirror at home - when “The Tracks of My Tears” finally came together. He remembers taking the wheel on the last 150 miles back to Detroit after a tour, humming the melody that would become the Temptations hit “The Way You Do the Things You Do.” He recalls being floored by the way a 10-year-old Michael Jackson brought a depth and soul to “Who’s Loving You.” And he explains where the term “Quiet Storm” originated, a song title that went on to become an entire musical genre.</p> <p>It’s a journey Robinson revisits with a grateful, humble heart. He has no agenda to push, no axes to grind, no scores to settle. He reflects on the ups as well as downs, and looks back with appreciation for the people who put love in his life. That makes listening a distinct pleasure: You get to spend time with a hugely influential artist who is warm, upbeat, and proud to have built a life and career through his art.</p>","releaseDate":"2020-11-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"length":"1h 35m ","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/001276/or_orig_001276_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Performance","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61jCQyokCqL","asin":"B08S5B25Y3","title":"Dispossession","authors":"Tayari Jones","narrators":"Gabrielle Union","length":"57 mins"},{"cover":"51PsnheQZ6L","asin":"B08KWNTR1M","title":"Alanis Morissette: Words + Music","authors":"Alanis Morissette","narrators":"Alanis Morissette","length":"1 hr and 31 mins"},{"cover":"51WV-3F8XiL","asin":"B08M93Q9SP","subHeading":"Montreal to New York","title":"Road Trip Elegies","authors":"Rufus Wainwright","narrators":"Rufus Wainwright","length":"3 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51Qs2dPG6XL","asin":"1735803200","title":"Fauci","authors":"Michael Specter","narrators":"Michael Specter","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"513y43PKExL","asin":"B08NWBF1Z3","subHeading":"My Life with Beethoven","title":"Unquiet","authors":"Jonathan Biss","narrators":"Jonathan Biss","length":"1 hr and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51AY3hc8xqL","asin":"B08HNJ2CZG","title":"Sheryl Crow: Words + Music","authors":"Sheryl Crow","narrators":"Sheryl Crow","length":"1 hr and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41rrK3zzDiL","asin":"0062931350","subHeading":"A Memoir","title":"Just as I Am","authors":"Cicely Tyson, Michelle Burford","narrators":"Cicely Tyson, Viola Davis, Robin Miles","length":"16 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51lctAfvrcL","asin":"B08C36PKWN","title":"Half Light","authors":"Tayari Jones","narrators":"Bahni Turpin","length":"1 hr and 20 mins"},{"cover":"611ulIElcsL","asin":"1541437586","subHeading":"Revised and Updated","title":"Temptations","authors":"Otis Williams, Patricia Romanowski - with","narrators":"JD Jackson, Otis Williams","length":"9 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"41bffUhJ4xL","asin":"0525633723","title":"A Promised Land","authors":"Barack Obama","narrators":"Barack Obama","length":"29 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"51W3tzUXA5L","asin":"B08P5F32XM","title":"People in Hell Want Ice Water","authors":"Edan Lepucki","narrators":"Dan Bittner","length":"1 hr and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51BGPJCkfsL","asin":"B08G1Z4ZJF","title":"St. Vincent: Words + Music","authors":"St. Vincent","narrators":"St. Vincent","length":"1 hr and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51ubEtGvm1L","asin":"B08DVCMY4Y","subHeading":"Speaking Truth to Power Through Stories and Song","title":"Tom Morello at Minetta Lane Theatre","authors":"Tom Morello","narrators":"Tom Morello","length":"1 hr and 42 mins"},{"cover":"612I4xe0IhL","asin":"B08BW1VY1X","title":"The Meaning of Mariah Carey","authors":"Mariah Carey","narrators":"Mariah Carey","length":"11 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51sgX-132lL","asin":"1250808421","subHeading":"Reckoning with Race in America","title":"Long Time Coming","authors":"Michael Eric Dyson","narrators":"Michael Eric Dyson","length":"4 hrs and 46 mins"},{"cover":"51h8RjYuMSL","asin":"B07YVLF72T","subHeading":"Romey University, Book 1","title":"Teach Me","authors":"Alexandria House","narrators":"Jakobi Diem, Adenrele Ojo","length":"9 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51UG6U-EjgL","asin":"B08PG5JBN5","title":"History of Wine in 10 Glasses","authors":"Paul Wagner","narrators":"Paul Wagner","length":"3 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51AsUIfn4xL","asin":"B08BTYG121","title":"Yard Work","authors":"David Koepp","narrators":"Kevin Bacon","length":"1 hr and 54 mins"}],"added":247},{"asin":"0593396960","cover":"516MN+bKViL","title":"Ready Player Two: A Novel","authors":[{"name":"Ernest Cline","url":"B004XRR8Z6"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Wil Wheaton"}],"series":[{"name":"Ready Player One","asin":"B08CM7ZZ11","bookNumbers":["2"]}],"blurb":"The highly anticipated sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller Ready Player One, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film....","downloaded":true,"progress":"58m left","titleShort":"Ready Player Two","ratings":34596,"rating":4.3,"summary":"<p><b>The highly anticipated sequel to the beloved worldwide best seller </b><b><i>Ready Player One</i></b><b>, the near-future adventure that inspired the blockbuster Steven Spielberg film. </b></p> <p><b>An unexpected quest.

This is an easy \"Yes\". Eliza has always preferred Nana Mora's beach cottage on St. Simons Island to the apartment she and her mom call home in the city. The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom. But Nana Mora is convinced it's real.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>With the help of an eccentric lighthouse keeper, Nana and Eliza pack up their gear and set out on their journey. As they travel, Eliza hears the real story of Sirens Harbor...along with the story of a fearsome mermaid named Silverswift, a warrior-princess rumored to have walked on the islands. Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them. It's almost as if some things are meant to stay secret. As if the harbor doesn't want to be found. Or as if, maybe, someone doesn't want them to find it....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>One thing is for sure: what Eliza and her grandmother actually discover on the night of the winter solstice will be better than any fairytale. As Nana Mora says: \"Some stories aren't fiction, my darling Eliza. Some stories are lifetimes.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","releaseDate":"2020-07-02","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18572092011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000943/or_orig_000943_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51mh9pHgpML","asin":"B08BDQ36W5","title":"Agent 355","authors":"Marie Benedict","narrators":"Emily Rankin","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51UDWvzOqeL","asin":"B08C3XGN8L","subHeading":"An Audible Original Novella","title":"The Cuckoo's Cry","authors":"Caroline Overington","narrators":"Aimee Horne","length":"4 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"514CDvM4UoL","asin":"B07RT12V4Q","title":"Life Ever After","authors":"Carla Grauls","narrators":"Raúl Castillo, Nana Mensah, Piper Goodeve","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51ll1lebmWL","asin":"B07SV4T7K7","subHeading":"An Audible Original","title":"The Space Race","authors":"Colin Brake, Patrick Chapman, Richard Hollingham, and others","narrators":"Kate Mulgrew","length":"9 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51pgZWQepWL","asin":"B0842XRT7P","title":"African-American Athletes Who Made History","authors":"Louis Moore, The Great Courses","narrators":"Louis Moore","length":"4 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51GKoszPFmL","asin":"B085F3F6CX","title":"Stuck","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51I5GD+LgIL","asin":"B088FG552H","subHeading":"A Novella","title":"Once More upon a Time","authors":"Roshani Chokshi","narrators":"Rebecca Gibel, Shiromi Arserio, Vikas Adam","length":"3 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","asin":"B082MQ5TDB","title":"Phreaks","authors":"Matthew Derby","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","title":"When You Finish Saving the World","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51rd998J9OL","asin":"B07KG3SWGL","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Henrietta & Eleanor: A Retelling of Jekyll and Hyde","authors":"Robert Louis Stevenson, Libby Spurrier - dramatist","narrators":"Holliday Grainger, Clive Mantle, Carla Mendonça, and others","length":"2 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51Di+gUJ9HL","asin":"B08DDCVRRC","title":"Thicker than Water","authors":"Tyler Shultz","narrators":"Tyler Shultz","length":"3 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51Ai-zC5tnL","asin":"B07X1TGC2Z","title":"Herbie","authors":"Rich Cohen","narrators":"Rich Cohen","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51sWmdvLSzL","asin":"B08DDD5V8J","subHeading":"Raising Kids During a Pandemic","title":"Childhood, Interrupted","authors":"Sanjay Gupta MD","narrators":"Dr. Sanjay Gupta","length":"46 mins"},{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"},{"cover":"51NK159FbkL","asin":"B089T5SW3N","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime","authors":"Dan Rather","narrators":"Dan Rather","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"516mu-GabiL","asin":"B08DG7X16V","subHeading":"A Journey Through Lyrics & Life","title":"Bluebird Memories","authors":"Common, Awoye Timpo, NSangou Njikam","narrators":"Common","length":"1 hr and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51YbF-pykmL","asin":"B0829D7FYM","title":"History of Bourbon","authors":"Ken Albala, The Great Courses","narrators":"Ken Albala","length":"3 hrs and 55 mins"}],"added":198},{"asin":"B07NP61PHX","cover":"613Evn1OK4L","title":"Andrea Vernon and the Superhero-Industrial Complex","authors":[{"name":"Alexander C.

And while it hasn't landed me a job, or a husband, it has convinced Her Majesty the Queen and the Dowager Duchess to enlist my help. I have been entrusted with grooming Jack Altringham - the Duke's newly discovered heir fresh from the Outback of Australia - for high society. The upside is I am to live in luxury at one of England's most gorgeous stately homes. But upon arrival at Kingsdowne Place, my dearest Darcy has been sent to fetch Jack, leaving me stuck in a manor full of miscreants…none of whom are too pleased with the discovery of my new ward. And no sooner has the lad been retrieved than the Duke announces he wants to choose his own heir. With the house in a hubbub over the news, Jack's hunting knife somehow finds its way into the Duke's back. Eyes fall, backs turn, and fingers point to the young heir. As if the rascal wasn't enough of a handful, now he's suspected of murder. Jack may be wild, but I'd bet the crown jewels it wasn't he who killed the Duke….\"</p>","releaseDate":"2013-08-06","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 22m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Mystery","url":"18574606011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/013539/bk_adbl_013539_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51VqbeMbLaL","asin":"B00M4MTZS0","title":"Queen of Hearts","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"10 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51R7BAiH-iL","asin":"B0118MSI3Y","title":"Malice at the Palace","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51Uji+7CYOL","asin":"B01HDTEWSG","title":"Crowned and Dangerous","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"617IJEFYHfL","asin":"B0744X249W","subHeading":"A Royal Spyness Mystery, Book 11","title":"On Her Majesty's Frightfully Secret Service","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Katherine Kellgren","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51V8+fOGvVL","asin":"B07FPQ2L4P","title":"Four Funerals and Maybe a Wedding","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Jasmine Blackborow","length":"9 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51EpH6SLTWL","asin":"B084T5J52D","subHeading":"Royal Spyness, Book 14","title":"The Last Mrs. Summers","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Jasmine Blackborow","length":"9 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"51l3nInaLUL","asin":"B00GR98DAM","title":"Murphy's Law","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"7 hrs and 32 mins"},{"cover":"51hvar2DMtL","asin":"B01N8ZU8KV","title":"Evans Above","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"61CBirgF+cL","asin":"B00C4VZTCW","title":"For the Love of Mike","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51Ry8FfCqVL","asin":"B00CO91EYG","title":"In Like Flynn","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51yGtia5-6L","asin":"B00CDNXR66","title":"Oh Danny Boy","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"11 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51zZZd8yRzL","asin":"B01MQMNAQJ","title":"Evan Help Us","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"6 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51Bdz-iPzvL","asin":"B00H84QU32","title":"Tell Me, Pretty Maiden","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"11 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51vd2OxGvHL","asin":"B00H84QOVK","subHeading":"Molly Murphy Series, Book 6","title":"In Dublin's Fair City","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"9 hrs and 8 mins"},{"cover":"51xtKf78nzL","asin":"B00H7IBKTS","subHeading":"A Molly Murphy Mystery, Book 10","title":"Bless the Bride","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"9 hrs and 38 mins"},{"cover":"512wDrpR0VL","asin":"B00CYRCOR4","title":"In a Gilded Cage","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"8 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51sqislG0mL","asin":"B01N458S73","title":"Evanly Choirs","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Roger Clark","length":"7 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"6110LGSx8-L","asin":"B00H3R0LHU","title":"The Last Illusion","authors":"Rhys Bowen","narrators":"Nicola Barber","length":"10 hrs and 11 mins"}],"added":195},{"asin":"B081ZFV1G3","cover":"51Us6vAMrsL","title":"Of Sea and Shadow: The Elder Empire: Sea, Book 1","authors":[{"name":"Will Wight","url":"B00D9S1IMO"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Travis Baldree"}],"series":[{"name":"The Elder Empire: Sea","asin":"B081V6TJLM","bookNumbers":["1"]}],"blurb":"The Guild of Navigators has ruled the Aion Sea for centuries, using their fleet of mystical ships to collect trade for the Aurelian Empire.

Each time, civilizations are ground to dust beneath the Demon King's hordes, but humanity has remained secure in the belief that a Hero of legend will always save them. There's just one slight problem. It's only been 23 years since the Demon King's latest rise, and this time, he's already conquered more than half the world.

And even if they succeed, the deadliest part of their journey may well be what awaits them at its end.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-09-23","publishers":[{"name":"Tantor Audio"}],"categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Humor & Satire","url":"18574496011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/tant/004106/bk_tant_004106_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61BUyIzxsFL","asin":"B018UG3DJK","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series #2","title":"Split the Party","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"11 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"615b2J3FgbL","asin":"B01NBOUV2D","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series, Book 3","title":"Going Rogue","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"15 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"617gcI+Q4sL","asin":"1977378889","subHeading":"Spells, Swords, & Stealth Series, Book 4","title":"Siege Tactics","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Roger Wayne","length":"15 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"61h4TKhp7NL","asin":"B06VV7NQJ5","subHeading":"Villains' Code Series, Book 1","title":"Forging Hephaestus","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Amy Landon","length":"26 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"61jv-6yHq5L","asin":"B01FEAXNKO","subHeading":"Super Powereds, Book 1","title":"Super Powereds: Year 1","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"26 hrs and 11 mins"},{"cover":"61ZHAA6jtKL","asin":"B01G11ZFYC","subHeading":"Super Powereds Spinoff, Book 1","title":"Corpies","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"19 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"514ppaAxSVL","asin":"B08S91CGBY","subHeading":"5-Minute Sherlock, Book 2","title":"The Case of the Haunted Haunted House","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Scott Aiello","length":"8 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"612QJjMowPL","asin":"B01L7V7WNS","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant, Book 3","title":"Bloody Acquisitions","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"9 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51KdVim8UUL","asin":"B07956BMDH","subHeading":"The Wraith's Haunt: A LitRPG Series, Book 1","title":"Dungeon Lord","authors":"Hugo Huesca","narrators":"Jeff Hays, Annie Ellicott","length":"9 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51hBJwW-ARL","asin":"B07FKY61BS","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series, Book 5","title":"Deadly Assessments","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"9 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51WyO2OZfdL","asin":"B08S5H4MKG","subHeading":"Life Reset - Neo, Book 5","title":"Life Reset: Conquest","authors":"Shemer Kuznits","narrators":"Jeff Hays, Annie Ellicott, Laurie Catherine Winkel","length":"13 hrs and 18 mins"},{"cover":"51Q6W9XjRvL","asin":"B07D84P11M","subHeading":"Super Powereds, Book 4","title":"Super Powereds: Year 4","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kyle McCarley","length":"60 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51T+N2n6FxL","asin":"1977346987","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series 6","title":"Undeading Bells","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"11 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61I50WRR6qL","asin":"B077H6GG9Z","subHeading":"Fred, the Vampire Accountant Series, Book 4","title":"The Fangs of Freelance","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"8 hrs and 21 mins"},{"cover":"51ZKPg5M+YL","asin":"B00TIY6GH0","title":"The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","length":"7 hrs and 2 mins"},{"cover":"51b6+0vNoPL","asin":"1648816606","title":"Super Powereds: Year One (1 of 3) (Dramatized Adaptation)","authors":"Drew Hayes","narrators":"full cast, Jonathan Lee Taylor, Darius Johnson, and others","length":"5 hrs and 57 mins"},{"cover":"41fJyK270ML","asin":"B07TDBYMPL","title":"Caverns and Creatures: Volume I (Books 1-4)","authors":"Robert Bevan","narrators":"Jonathan Sleep","length":"32 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"61MQvtBgHCL","asin":"B07KWG9LBY","subHeading":"Archemi Online, Volume 1","title":"Dragon Seed","authors":"James Osiris Baldwin","narrators":"Justin Thomas James, Jeff Hays, Laurie Catherine Winkel","length":"12 hrs and 38 mins"}],"added":170},{"asin":"B00G2H1306","cover":"51ujBijhDAL","title":"Curtsies & Conspiracies: Finishing School, Book 2","authors":[{"name":"Gail Carriger","url":"B002BML6TE"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Moira Quirk"}],"series":[{"name":"Finishing School","asin":"B00G3DISCU","bookNumbers":["2"]}],"blurb":"Sophronia's first year at Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality has certainly been rousing!

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-11-14","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 57m ","categories":[{"name":"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574597011"},{"name":"Thriller & Suspense","url":"18574621011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/027881/bk_adbl_027881_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51tuexbxdIL","asin":"B071Y9TTHC","title":"Children of Time","authors":"Adrian Tchaikovsky","narrators":"Mel Hudson","length":"16 hrs and 31 mins"},{"cover":"414J3xG+7+L","asin":"B082BHJMFF","title":"The Martian","authors":"Andy Weir","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51CE3t95FqL","asin":"B007SP2LPM","subHeading":"A Novel with Three Codas","title":"Redshirts","authors":"John Scalzi","narrators":"Wil Wheaton","length":"7 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51rLsWqI5-L","asin":"B01N48VJFJ","subHeading":"Expeditionary Force, Book 1","title":"Columbus Day","authors":"Craig Alanson","narrators":"R.C.

As the city prepares to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, Veronica Speedwell is marking a milestone of her own. After burying her spinster aunt, the orphaned Veronica is free to resume her world travels in pursuit of scientific inquiry - and the occasional romantic dalliance. As familiar with hunting butterflies as she is fending off admirers, Veronica wields her butterfly net and a sharpened hatpin with equal aplomb, and with her last connection to England now gone, she intends to embark upon the journey of a lifetime. But fate has other plans, as Veronica discovers when she thwarts her own abduction with the help of an enigmatic German baron with ties to her mysterious past. Promising to reveal in time what he knows of the plot against her, the baron offers her temporary sanctuary in the care of his friend Stoker - a reclusive natural historian as intriguing as he is bad-tempered. But before the baron can deliver on his tantalizing vow to reveal the secrets he has concealed for decades, he is found murdered. Suddenly Veronica and Stoker are forced to go on the run from an elusive assailant, wary partners in search of the villainous truth. </p>","releaseDate":"2015-09-03","publishers":[{"name":"Recorded Books"}],"length":"10h 51m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/reco/008882/bk_reco_008882_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51++gmAM++L","asin":"B01NBPFSAW","title":"A Perilous Undertaking","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"12 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51B3-QzwUML","asin":"B078JNYV9V","title":"A Treacherous Curse","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"11 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"51IVEZsrCJL","asin":"1501986171","title":"A Dangerous Collaboration","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"12 hrs and 33 mins"},{"cover":"51xA5s0gqML","asin":"150198618X","subHeading":"Veronica Speedwell Mysteries, Book 5","title":"A Murderous Relation","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Angele Masters","length":"11 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51iJoPticrL","asin":"B002V1OGB0","title":"Silent in the Grave","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 54 mins"},{"cover":"511Np-ZkyKL","asin":"B002V0K4FI","title":"Silent in the Sanctuary","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51cb3muYo4L","asin":"B002V0QEAM","title":"Silent on the Moor","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"12 hrs and 19 mins"},{"cover":"51kVHifEKlL","asin":"B00571RZSM","subHeading":"A Lady Julia Grey Novel","title":"The Dark Enquiry","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"11 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"51GEtCb4WlL","asin":"B0042LJ1OY","title":"Dark Road to Darjeeling","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"11 hrs and 44 mins"},{"cover":"51fBzkWz7yL","asin":"059329209X","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 5","title":"Murder on Cold Street","authors":"Sherry Thomas","narrators":"Kate Reading","length":"13 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51K5u0oXqxL","asin":"0593151550","subHeading":"The Lady Sherlock Series, Book 4","title":"The Art of Theft","authors":"Sherry Thomas","narrators":"Kate Reading","length":"10 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"518vYcWLcbL","asin":"B00RC0S5KI","title":"Twelfth Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"1 hr and 58 mins"},{"cover":"51WPvDDOXQL","asin":"B00RC0S5XU","title":"Midsummer Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"2 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51Gk-j4cBQL","asin":"B009PANL3O","subHeading":"A Lady Julia Christmas Novella","title":"Silent Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"1 hr and 54 mins"},{"cover":"61yVLxOWu0L","asin":"B07KJSPB3W","subHeading":"Beatrice Hyde-Clare Mysteries, Book 1","title":"A Brazen Curiosity: A Regency Cozy","authors":"Lynn Messina","narrators":"Jill Smith","length":"7 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51DWIZoCIwL","asin":"B010EARZPS","title":"Bonfire Night","authors":"Deanna Raybourn","narrators":"Ellen Archer","length":"2 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"51cWHxI7dAL","asin":"B07YSJ5MFZ","subHeading":"Heathcliff Lennox Series, Book 1","title":"Murder at Melrose Court","authors":"Karen Menuhin","narrators":"Sam Dewhurst-Phillips","length":"6 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"518Rfim9p3L","asin":"B07PCX69DQ","subHeading":"Beatrice Hyde-Clare Mysteries, Book 2","title":"A Scandalous Deception: A Regency Cozy","authors":"Lynn Messina","narrators":"Jill Smith","length":"7 hrs and 21 mins"}],"added":147},{"asin":"B015RJL1Z6","cover":"51PJcOVR-TL","title":"Carmilla","authors":[{"name":"Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu","url":"B00456AFZA"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Phoebe Fox"},{"name":"Rose Leslie"},{"name":"David Tennant"},{"name":"David Horovitch"},{"name":"James Wilby"},{"name":"Susan Wooldridge"},{"name":"Hannah Genesius"}],"blurb":"Audible Originals bring you a brand new audiobook adaptation of J.

Told in alternating perspectives, it's the perfect love story for fans of the series and new listeners alike.&nbsp;</p> <p>Petite though she may be, Zuzana is not known for timidity. Her best friend, Karou, calls her \"rabid fairy\", her \"voodoo eyes\" are said to freeze blood, and even her older brother fears her wrath. But when it comes to the simple matter of talking to Mik, or \"Violin Boy\", her courage deserts her. Now, enough is enough. Zuzana is determined to meet him, and she has a fistful of magic and a plan. It's a wonderfully elaborate treasure hunt of a plan that will take Mik all over Prague on a cold winter's night before finally leading him to the treasure: herself!&nbsp;</p> <p>Violin Boy's not going to know what hit him.&nbsp;</p> <p>*Booktrack is an immersive format that pairs traditional audiobook narration to complementary music.

But when an out-of-control driver smashes into a buggy driven by Constance, Norma, and Fleurette Kopp, their lives change forever. Constance, the oldest, demands payment for the damages but quickly realizes that she is dealing with a madman - Henry Kaufman, a silk manufacturer with a drinking problem and a dangerous group of associates. </p> <p>Soon the Kopp home is under siege. The sisters face threats of arson, kidnapping, and white slavery. Bricks come flying through their windows, and shots are fired at their house late at night. Even the sheriff can't solve the case on his own. He issues revolvers to the Kopp sisters, posts guards at their house, and enlists Constance's help in catching Kaufman. In the process Constance finds herself pulled into an underworld of abused factory workers, missing children, and dirty dealings. </p> <p>Her attempts to help another woman in trouble forces her to confront her own past and imagine a different future for herself and her sisters.

All but doomed, her days are spent toiling away as a kitchen slave under the charge of the Aldermaston, the Abbey’s watchful overseer. But when an injured squire named Colvin is abandoned at the kitchen’s doorstep, an opportunity arises.

Charles Darwin's brilliant discovery challenged the creationist arguments; but only Richard Dawkins could have written this elegant riposte. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process Darwin discovered - is the blind watchmaker in nature.</p>","releaseDate":"2011-07-05","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"categories":null,"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/002905/bk_adbl_002905_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61eQEOTYw-L","asin":"B07MNH2T6M","subHeading":"Big Ideas Simply Explained","title":"The Philosophy Book","authors":"DK","narrators":"Jason Culp","length":"16 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51rn8IJrEhL","asin":"1682769992","title":"Black Holes, Tides, and Curved Spacetime","authors":"Benjamin Schumacher, The Great Courses","narrators":"Benjamin Schumacher","length":"12 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"61DnhlAdt5L","asin":"B075B1ZM1Q","subHeading":"Einstein, Gravitational Waves, and the Future of Astronomy","title":"Ripples in Spacetime","authors":"Govert Schilling, Martin Rees","narrators":"Joel Richards","length":"11 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51v3mc89wtL","asin":"B003X3RJE6","subHeading":"A Story of Evolution in Our Time","title":"The Beak of the Finch","authors":"Jonathan Weiner","narrators":"Victor Bevine","length":"12 hrs and 14 mins"},{"cover":"510Y5qH15uL","asin":"B00375CTPE","subHeading":"The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time","title":"From Eternity to Here","authors":"Sean Carroll","narrators":"Erik Synnestvedt","length":"16 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"61S4aDkYjsL","asin":"B00HFXCS96","subHeading":"Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies","title":"The Second Machine Age","authors":"Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee","narrators":"Jeff Cummings","length":"8 hrs and 49 mins"},{"cover":"61gq5FFgFRL","asin":"B006P482NC","title":"The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution","authors":"Francis Fukuyama","narrators":"Jonathan Davis","length":"22 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"51gEtUAPuKL","asin":"B07BH3R926","subHeading":"Why the Education System Is a Waste of Time and Money","title":"The Case Against Education","authors":"Bryan Caplan","narrators":"Allan Robertson","length":"11 hrs"},{"cover":"61DuUi-PFKL","asin":"B0179XK9VU","subHeading":"The Phenomenon That Reimagines Space and Time-and What It Means for Black Holes, the Big Bang, and Theories of Everything","title":"Spooky Action at a Distance","authors":"George Musser","narrators":"William Hughes","length":"8 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"41gvW2l0-9L","asin":"B00T3J3M54","subHeading":"Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time","title":"The Upward Spiral","authors":"Alex Korb PhD.","narrators":"David deVries","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins"},{"cover":"61zewFaBaYL","asin":"B002V086LM","subHeading":"The Evidence for Evolution","title":"The Greatest Show on Earth","authors":"Richard Dawkins","narrators":"Richard Dawkins, Lalla Ward","length":"14 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"61LKr3EaaSL","asin":"B0062PG1Z0","subHeading":"The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla: Biography of a Genius","title":"Wizard","authors":"Marc J.

In Dr. Kaku's eyes, we are living in a golden age of physics, as new discoveries from the WMAP and COBE satellites and the Hubble space telescope have given us unprecedented pictures of our universe in its infancy. </p> <p>As astronomers wade through the avalanche of data from the WMAP satellite, a new cosmological picture is emerging. So far the leading theory about the birth of the universe is the \"inflationary universe theory\", a major refinement on the big bang theory. In this theory our universe may be but one in a multiverse, floating like a bubble in an infinite sea of bubble universes, with new universes being created all the time. A parallel universe may well hover a mere millimeter from our own. </p> <p>The very idea of parallel universes and the string theory that can explain their existence was once viewed with suspicion by scientists, seen as the province of mystics, charlatans, and cranks. But today physicists overwhelmingly support string theory and its latest iteration, M-theory, as it is this one theory that, if proven correct, would reconcile the four forces of the universe simply and elegantly and answer the question \"what happened before the big bang?\" </p> <p>Already, Kaku explains, the world's foremost physicists and astronomers are searching for ways to test the theory of the multiverse using highly sophisticated wave detectors, gravity lenses, satellites, and telescopes. The implications of M-theory are fascinating and endless. If parallel worlds do exist, Kaku speculates, in time - perhaps a trillion years or more from now, as appears likely - when our universe grows cold and dark in what scientists describe as a big freeze, advanced civilizations may well find a way to escape our universe in a kind of \"interdimensional lifeboat\". </p> <p>An unforgettable journey into black holes and time machines, alternate universes, and multidimensional space, <i>Parallel Worlds</i> gives us a compelling portrait of the revolution sweeping the world of cosmology. </p>","releaseDate":"2016-07-05","publishers":[{"name":"Random House Audio"}],"length":"14h 50m ","categories":[{"name":"Science & Engineering","url":"18580540011"},{"name":"Science","url":"18580555011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/rand/004635/bk_rand_004635_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"518fbTX6auL","asin":"B002V0GGGO","subHeading":"A Scientific Exploration","title":"Physics of the Impossible","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"11 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51UjXZTTHwL","asin":"B00HUBJ8NM","subHeading":"The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind","title":"The Future of the Mind","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"15 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"61S2HXwgipL","asin":"B075F9R9DD","subHeading":"Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth","title":"The Future of Humanity","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"12 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"51VZakPBGpL","asin":"B004OFVVW8","subHeading":"How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100","title":"Physics of the Future","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Feodor Chin","length":"15 hrs and 39 mins"},{"cover":"615wPw7acCL","asin":"B00CX727KE","subHeading":"How Albert Einstein's Vision Transformed Our Understanding of Space and Time: Great Discoveries","title":"Einstein's Cosmos","authors":"Michio Kaku","narrators":"Ray Porter","length":"6 hrs and 30 mins"},{"cover":"51HgJDRBbRL","asin":"B004GVIRFO","subHeading":"Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos","title":"The Hidden Reality","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Brian Greene","length":"13 hrs and 48 mins"},{"cover":"51RbY4CYMxL","asin":"B002V1K1IM","subHeading":"Space, Time, and the Texture of Reality","title":"The Fabric of the Cosmos","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Michael Prichard","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51AAyE4rGeL","asin":"B002V0TEUO","subHeading":"Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory","title":"The Elegant Universe","authors":"Brian Greene","narrators":"Erik Davies","length":"15 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"51fa7PyEWVL","asin":"0525592474","subHeading":"Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime","title":"Something Deeply Hidden","authors":"Sean Carroll","narrators":"Sean Carroll","length":"10 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"51G9pDUq6IL","asin":"B01N7RT1ZG","subHeading":"An Astrophysical Tour","title":"Welcome to the Universe","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A.

This lively comedy of manners with its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, it is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.</p> <p>Featuring: Alexa Davies, Joanne Froggatt, Adam Gillen, Rupert Holliday-Evans, Isabella Inchbald, Aisling Loftus, Anjella Mackintosh, Joseph Millson, Ukweli Roach, Morgana Robinson, Nicholas Rowe, Emma Thompson, Benjamin Wainwright, Eve Webster and Ria Zmitrowicz.</p>","releaseDate":"2018-09-04","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"8h 21m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000226/or_orig_000226_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Original Recording Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51l+3eFfAmL","asin":"B0877BC6PP","title":"The Office","authors":"Whisperlodge","narrators":"Will Watt","length":"38 mins"},{"cover":"51NmlV2M8BL","asin":"B0877CXKYX","title":"Cape Cod National Seashore","authors":"Gordon Hempton","narrators":"54 mins","length":"Original Recording"},{"cover":"41NxWHKqMtL","asin":"B0877WF83H","title":"Loving Kindness","authors":"Bram Barouh","narrators":"Bram Barouh","length":"8 mins"},{"cover":"41xYKEMxgGL","asin":"B0877CK624","title":"The Perfect Swing","authors":"James McGirk","narrators":"Nick Jonas","length":"37 mins"},{"cover":"41bIKHsNriL","asin":"B0877CC66D","title":"Center Yourself","authors":"Agapi Stassinopoulos","narrators":"Agapi Stassinopoulos","length":"18 mins"},{"cover":"412zlrSCV2L","asin":"B0877CHZZ2","title":"Rest and Digest","authors":"Sara Auster","narrators":"Sara Auster","length":"10 mins"},{"cover":"51vY937eQYL","asin":"B0877DG21W","title":"You Are Here","authors":"Gabrielle Bernstein","narrators":"Gabrielle Bernstein","length":"7 mins"},{"cover":"51+Iu4yAJqL","asin":"B0877DSTBM","title":"Crystal Bowl Breathing","authors":"The Big Quiet","narrators":"Jesse Israel","length":"10 mins"},{"cover":"41dHfrJ-5OL","asin":"B0877D7PGV","title":"Honor Yourself","authors":"Diddy","narrators":"Diddy","length":"25 mins"},{"cover":"51TyQNTZVlL","asin":"B07FDJQ8YH","title":"Sense and Sensibility","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 25 mins"},{"cover":"51YHL3AY2rL","asin":"B082MQ5TDB","title":"Phreaks","authors":"Matthew Derby","narrators":"Ben McKenzie, Carrie Coon, Christian Slater, and others","length":"5 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"518x9ZiVZbL","asin":"B08DDC8Y8F","title":"When You Finish Saving the World","authors":"Jesse Eisenberg","narrators":"Kaitlyn Dever, Jesse Eisenberg, Finn Wolfhard","length":"5 hrs and 17 mins"},{"cover":"51Di+gUJ9HL","asin":"B08DDCVRRC","title":"Thicker than Water","authors":"Tyler Shultz","narrators":"Tyler Shultz","length":"3 hrs and 36 mins"},{"cover":"513oKbpMTgL","asin":"B08DDJ56J2","title":"The Year of Magical Thinking","authors":"Joan Didion","narrators":"Vanessa Redgrave","length":"1 hr and 28 mins"},{"cover":"51NK159FbkL","asin":"B089T5SW3N","title":"Dan Rather: Stories of a Lifetime","authors":"Dan Rather","narrators":"Dan Rather","length":"1 hr and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51GKoszPFmL","asin":"B085F3F6CX","title":"Stuck","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","narrators":"Mark Sanderlin, Elizabeth Hess, Oliver Wyman, and others","length":"3 hrs and 12 mins"},{"cover":"51aNFG4ELmL","asin":"B072JZ18JB","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"Northanger Abbey","authors":"Jane Austen, Anna Lea - adaptation","narrators":"Emma Thompson, Douglas Booth, Eleanor Tomlinson, and others","length":"6 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"51Hhvqc6SML","asin":"B0883GHNZQ","title":"Bella Bella","authors":"Harvey Fierstein","narrators":"Harvey Fierstein","length":"1 hr and 13 mins"}],"added":81},{"asin":"B07FKTV9PG","cover":"51MUCSJQbQL","title":"Once Upon a River","authors":[{"name":"Diane Setterfield","url":"B001H6IYHC"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Juliet Stevenson"}],"blurb":"A body always tells a story - but this child’s was a blank page. \"Who are you?\" she murmured, but the face said as little as the rest of her.

Each wave different, and each wave stronger.</i> </p> <p>Ray Bradbury is a storyteller without peer, a poet of the possible, and, indisputably, one of America's most beloved authors. In a much-celebrated literary career that has spanned six decades, he has produced an astonishing body of work: unforgettable novels, including <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>; essays, theatrical works, screenplays and teleplays; <i>The Illustrated Mein</i>, <i>Dandelion Wine</i>, <i>The October Country</i>, and numerous other superb short story collections. But of all the dazzling stars in the vast Bradbury universe, none shines more luminous than these masterful chronicles of Earth's settlement of the fourth world from the sun. </p> <p>Bradbury's Mars is a place of hope, dreams, and metaphor - of crystal pillars and fossil seas - where a fine dust settles on the great, empty cities of a silently destroyed civilization. It is here the invaders have come to despoil and commercialize, to grow and to learn - first a trickle, then a torrent, rushing from a world with no future toward a promise of tomorrow. The Earthman conquers Mars...and then is conquered by it, lulled by dangerous lies of comfort and familiarity, and enchanted by the lingering glamour of an ancient, mysterious native race. </p> <p>Ray Bradbury's <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> is a classic work of 20th-century literature whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage. In connected, chronological stories, a true grandmaster once again enthralls, delights, and challenges us with his vision and his heart - starkly and stunningly exposing in brilliant spacelight our strength, our weakness, our folly, and our poignant humanity on a strange and breathtaking world where humanity does not belong.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-10-21","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"7h 43m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/018699/bk_adbl_018699_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51JtgYHw50L","asin":"B003Z428D0","title":"The Illustrated Man","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"Scott Brick","length":"9 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"5172mjVg2KL","asin":"B00KQBMIBW","title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"Christian Rummel","length":"9 hrs and 5 mins"},{"cover":"61AEXh2FA6L","asin":"B07DFS18PQ","title":"The October Country","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"David Aaron Baker","length":"10 hrs and 59 mins"},{"cover":"51fA4UHQkNL","asin":"B07815BZBZ","title":"Dandelion Wine","authors":"Ray Bradbury","narrators":"David Aaron Baker","length":"8 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51VkYmskdQL","asin":"B01EVPMGEM","title":"Martian Time-Slip","authors":"Philip K.

Now, in yet another virtuosic performance, the actor proves that despite being separated by a span of over a century, his connection to the author and his work is undeniable and that theirs is a timeless collaboration that should not be missed. Trading in the idyllic banks of Twain's Mississippi for medieval England, Offerman regales listeners with one of American literature's foremost satires and the author's most inventive and darkly funny pieces of fiction. </p> <p>Hank Morgan is the archetype of modern man in 19th-century New England: adept at his trade as a mechanic, innovative, forward thinking. So when a blow to the head inexplicably sends him back in time 1300 years and places him in Camelot, instead of despair, he feels emboldened by the prospect placed before him and sets out to modernize and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. But, in order to do so, he'll need to contend with brash nobles, superstitious nincompoops, and a conniving, blowhard wizard. </p> <p>While time travel has become a common trope in storytelling today, in Twain's time it was truly a novel idea; all the more imaginative when you consider how it's used for satirical effect. A thinly veiled critique of the political and social institutions that impede progress and a scathing condemnation of the naiveté that allows them to thrive, <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> saw Twain's biting wit and sharp tongue honed to a fine point. </p> <p>Told primarily through Hank's first-person perspective, Offerman effortlessly captures the Yankee's straightforward, matter-of-fact gruffness. Like Offerman - whose woodworking skills are the stuff of legend - Hank is a natural builder of things and his can-do, by-the-bootstraps spirit finds its vocal foil in Offerman's crisp delivery. But it's in Offerman's ability to convey the myriad characters and absurdities Hank faces that makes this an incomparable listening experience: the flowery embellishments and insane braggadocio of knights; the lilting, feathery sing-song of Clarence; the garrulous, long-winded pomp of the aristocracy; the old, dithering windbag pronouncements of Merlin. Offerman plays each of these with a humor and humanity that Twain himself would have enjoyed. </p>","releaseDate":"2017-09-19","publishers":[{"name":"Audible Studios"}],"length":"13h 25m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/adbl/029631/bk_adbl_029631_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","series":null,"peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"61OhDUE9CKL","asin":"B01HQMQLWK","title":"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Nick Offerman","length":"7 hrs and 52 mins"},{"cover":"51ef+s6y42L","asin":"B0078PA1OA","title":"Dracula [Audible Edition]","authors":"Bram Stoker","narrators":"Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, and others","length":"15 hrs and 28 mins"},{"cover":"61ZRKnCssaL","asin":"B01FN88BHC","title":"Anna Karenina","authors":"Leo Tolstoy","narrators":"Maggie Gyllenhaal","length":"35 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51vyUoMpjkL","asin":"B076DJLFRF","title":"Murder in an English Village","authors":"Jessica Ellicott","narrators":"Barbara Rosenblat","length":"9 hrs and 26 mins"},{"cover":"51UV56nCgvL","asin":"B06VX4GHHG","subHeading":"Life Lessons","title":"I Can't Make This Up","authors":"Neil Strauss - contributor, Kevin Hart","narrators":"Kevin Hart","length":"11 hrs and 15 mins"},{"cover":"51WstlmPV6L","asin":"B00K0S7MQW","title":"The Age of Faith, Volume 4","authors":"Will Durant","narrators":"Stefan Rudnicki","length":"61 hrs and 23 mins"},{"cover":"61j+AB3GUoL","asin":"B06X9MXN32","title":"Astrophysics for People in a Hurry","authors":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","narrators":"Neil deGrasse Tyson","length":"3 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"51Sc+GQHn-L","asin":"B00D94TX02","title":"1066: The Year That Changed Everything","authors":"Jennifer Paxton, The Great Courses","narrators":"Jennifer Paxton","length":"3 hrs"},{"cover":"61uvEAJX2yL","asin":"B002V5IX3I","title":"Joan of Arc","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Michael Anthony","length":"15 hrs and 42 mins"},{"cover":"51Wl2hPRt5L","asin":"B00FFHJXSI","title":"The Things They Carried","authors":"Tim O'Brien","narrators":"Bryan Cranston","length":"7 hrs and 47 mins"},{"cover":"51R3eluF7jL","asin":"B00NQDMLSW","subHeading":"A History of Civilization in Italy from 1304 - 1576 AD, The Story of Civilization, Volume 5","title":"The Renaissance","authors":"Will Durant","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"37 hrs and 9 mins"},{"cover":"61IW-XFc9sL","asin":"B004GVNIEY","title":"Life on the Mississippi [Blackstone]","authors":"Mark Twain","narrators":"Grover Gardner","length":"13 hrs and 37 mins"},{"cover":"51eo26hWHLL","asin":"B005QPB3X2","subHeading":"How the World Became Modern","title":"The Swerve","authors":"Stephen Greenblatt","narrators":"Edoardo Ballerini","length":"9 hrs and 41 mins"},{"cover":"61BgXkJCauL","asin":"B002V0TGKM","title":"Oliver Twist","authors":"Charles Dickens","narrators":"Simon Vance","length":"16 hrs and 7 mins"},{"cover":"51Y1Wy710HL","asin":"B01COOZ5C2","title":"Jane Eyre","authors":"Charlotte Bronte","narrators":"Thandie Newton","length":"19 hrs and 10 mins"},{"cover":"5127OtHzHuL","asin":"B00FQRCM9O","title":"Frankenstein","authors":"Mary Shelley","narrators":"Dan Stevens","length":"8 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51y-ivhKErL","asin":"B016LN23CC","title":"Pride and Prejudice","authors":"Jane Austen","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","length":"11 hrs and 35 mins"},{"cover":"51AyV7rsScL","asin":"B015ELUYL4","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five","authors":"Kurt Vonnegut","narrators":"James Franco","length":"5 hrs and 13 mins"}],"added":63},{"asin":"B002UZMVSC","cover":"51zv-hPTgKL","title":"House of Many Ways","authors":[{"name":"Diana Wynne Jones","url":"B000AP7PX0"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Jenny Sterlin"}],"series":[{"name":"Howl's Castle","asin":"B073V4CGZN","bookNumbers":["3"]}],"blurb":"A girl named Charmain must inhabit her ailing great-uncle's time-traveling home full of magical belongings....","downloaded":true,"progress":"Finished","myRating":"5","titleShort":"House of Many Ways","ratings":1347,"rating":4.7,"summary":"Recipient of two Boston Globe-Horn Book Award Honors, beloved fantasy and children's author Diana Wynne Jones presents this exciting sequel to her novel <i>Howl's Moving Castle</i>, which was transformed into an Academy Award®-nominated motion picture. <p>A girl named Charmain must inhabit her ailing great-uncle's time-traveling home full of magical belongings.

Wizardly partners Kit Rodriguez and Nita Callahan, and Nita's sister, former wizard-prodigy Dairine Callahan, are drafted in to mentor two brilliant and difficult cases: for Nita and Kit, there's Penn Shao-Feng, a would-be sun technician with a dangerous new take on managing solar weather; and for Dairine, there's shy young Mehrnaz Farrahi, an Iranian wizard-girl trying to specialize in defusing earthquakes while struggling with a toxic extended wizardly family that demands she perform to their expectations. </p> <p>Together they're plunged into a whirlwind of cutthroat competition and ruthless judging.

A young man’s dark obsession with an enigmatic, gorgeous writer leads to murderous consequences in this erotic psychological thriller. </p> <p><i>You walk into the bookstore and you keep your hand on the door to make sure it doesn’t slam. You smile, embarrassed to be a nice girl, and your nails are bare and your V-neck sweater is beige and it’s impossible to know if you’re wearing a bra but I don’t think that you are. You’re so clean that you’re dirty and you murmur your first word to me - hello.</i> </p> <p>When aspiring writer and recent Brown graduate Guinevere Beck strides into the bookstore where Joe works, he’s instantly smitten. Beck is everything Joe has ever wanted: she's gorgeous, tough, razor-smart, and sexy beyond his wildest dreams. Joe needs to have her, and he'll stop at nothing to do so. As he begins to insinuate himself into her life - her friendships, her email, her phone - she can’t resist her feelings for a guy who seems custom-made for her. So when her boyfriend, Benji, mysteriously disappears, Beck and Joe fall into a tumultuous affair. But there's more to Beck than her oh-so-perfect façade, and their mutual obsession quickly spirals into a whirlwind of deadly consequences. </p> <p>Dark, masterful, and timely, debut novelist Caroline Kepnes' <i>You</i> is a perversely romantic thriller that's more dangerously clever than any you've heard before. A chilling account of unrelenting passion, this tale of love, sex, and death will stay with you long after the story ends.</p>","releaseDate":"2014-09-30","publishers":[{"name":"Simon & Schuster Audio"}],"length":"11h 6m ","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"sample":"https://samples.audible.com/bk/sans/006829/bk_sans_006829_sample.mp3","language":"English","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","peopleAlsoBought":[{"cover":"51o7D1bFafL","asin":"B019HMZ2RM","title":"Hidden Bodies","authors":"Caroline Kepnes","narrators":"Santino Fontana","length":"13 hrs and 3 mins"},{"cover":"51Nr0kYeKsL","asin":"B079J6RJRG","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Providence","authors":"Caroline Kepnes","narrators":"MacLeod Andrews, Emily Rankin, Paul Michael","length":"12 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51JQaVcuvmL","asin":"B007JX1GPY","subHeading":"Dexter, Book 1","title":"Darkly Dreaming Dexter","authors":"Jeff Lindsay","narrators":"Jeff Lindsay","length":"7 hrs and 51 mins"},{"cover":"51rtHzQEASL","asin":"B00K8F589A","title":"Big Little Lies","authors":"Liane Moriarty","narrators":"Caroline Lee","length":"15 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"51amiTSnkCL","asin":"B007MRLLXO","subHeading":"Dexter, Book 2","title":"Dearly Devoted Dexter","authors":"Jeff Lindsay","narrators":"Jeff Lindsay","length":"8 hrs and 24 mins"},{"cover":"51cSlRutl5L","asin":"B002VA9TOU","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Dark Places","authors":"Gillian Flynn","narrators":"Rebecca Lowman, Cassandra Campbell, Mark Deakins, and others","length":"13 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"51DBy4o25tL","asin":"1250317533","title":"The Silent Patient","authors":"Alex Michaelides","narrators":"Jack Hawkins, Louise Brealey","length":"8 hrs and 43 mins"},{"cover":"61TaNQhwihL","asin":"059321000X","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Pretty Things","authors":"Janelle Brown","narrators":"Julia Whelan, Lauren Fortgang, Hillary Huber","length":"16 hrs and 6 mins"},{"cover":"41cOneNpRTL","asin":"0593394445","subHeading":"A You Novel","title":"You Love Me","authors":"Caroline Kepnes","narrators":"Santino Fontana","length":"14 hrs"},{"cover":"41FIQf-xzhL","asin":"B00QXW5GYY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Girl on the Train","authors":"Paula Hawkins","narrators":"Clare Corbett, Louise Brealey, India Fisher","length":"10 hrs and 58 mins"},{"cover":"61-7gsFvUOL","asin":"B01N0BGPO9","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Behind Her Eyes","authors":"Sarah Pinborough","narrators":"Anna Bentinck, Josie Dunn, Bea Holland, and others","length":"11 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"51wbPVCktdL","asin":"0062985051","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"The Guest List","authors":"Lucy Foley","narrators":"Jot Davies, Chloe Massey, Olivia Dowd, and others","length":"10 hrs and 22 mins"},{"cover":"512CjwZnufL","asin":"1690582162","subHeading":"A Twisted Psychological Thriller","title":"The Housekeeper","authors":"Natalie Barelli","narrators":"Susie Berneis","length":"8 hrs and 4 mins"},{"cover":"41xThcH7SLL","asin":"B019WPM4ZM","title":"It","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Steven Weber","length":"44 hrs and 55 mins"},{"cover":"5106jN4KGNL","asin":"B002V1O4XU","title":"American Psycho","authors":"Bret Easton Ellis","narrators":"Pablo Schreiber","length":"16 hrs and 29 mins"},{"cover":"41SAMIHkYCL","asin":"148820697X","title":"The Wives","authors":"Tarryn Fisher","narrators":"Lauren Fortgang","length":"9 hrs"},{"cover":"51T0YJNyKqL","asin":"B008OLF29Q","title":"The Shining","authors":"Stephen King","narrators":"Campbell Scott","length":"15 hrs and 50 mins"},{"cover":"51tNr4hcdWL","asin":"B00CD6XOXY","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Dexter in the Dark","authors":"Jeff Lindsay","narrators":"Jeff Lindsay","length":"10 hrs and 28 mins"}],"added":36},{"asin":"B002VAA8N6","cover":"51ZK4jRSfnL","title":"Witch Week: Chronicles of Chrestomanci","authors":[{"name":"Diana Wynne Jones","url":"B000AP7PX0"}],"narrators":[{"name":"Gerard Doyle"}],"series":[{"name":"The Worlds of Chrestomanci","asin":"B073V4H35D","bookNumbers":["3"]}],"blurb":"The students in class 6B become nervous when their teacher receives an anonymous note claiming someone in the room is a witch....","downloaded":true,"progress":"Finished","myRating":"5","titleShort":"Witch Week","ratings":278,"rating":4.4,"summary":"The students in class 6B become nervous when their teacher receives an anonymous note claiming someone in the room is a witch.

She is about to start seventh grade, and for kids from Maine's Burning Fog Island, that means leaving their little white schoolhouse for regular classrooms and life on the mainland. Everyone assures Christina it will be a fantastic year. Mainland school offers great advantages, after all: extracurricular activities other than boating and fishing, a gym, a cafeteria, and more kids her age. Best of all, this year the boarding students will live at the historic Schooner Inne, a former sea captain's house (and now a bed and breakfast) recently bought by the school's charismatic new principal and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Shevvington. </p><p>But Christina is apprehensive. She adores the wildness and excitement of her island life. Boarding with her island friends will surely help: Anya, a beautiful senior, fifteen-year-old Benji, the aspiring lobsterman, and his crush-worthy younger brother Michael. But Christina's apprehension sharpens when Benji and Michael aren't as friendly as they used to be on the island, and Anya starts acting so strangely it seems she is slowly losing her mind. Christina is increasingly certain the Shevvingtons are behind all of these changes. But no one else can see the Shevvingtons' eerie behavior - not other teachers, not her parents, not even her fellow island kids.

A brilliant young boy, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut - young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister.

Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick's clever and beautiful wife disappears from their rented McMansion on the Mississippi River. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn't doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife's head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. </p> <p>Under mounting pressure from the police and the media - as well as Amy's fiercely doting parents - the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior.

A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen. A world in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother Abagail - and the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.</p> <p>In 1978, Stephen King published <i>The Stand</i>, the novel that is now considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published, <i>The Stand</i> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had been cut from the original manuscript.</p> <p>Now Stephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been restored to its entirety. <i>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition</i> includes material previously deleted, along with new material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new generation.
